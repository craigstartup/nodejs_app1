07:02 - Executive summary 

A good YouTube description mainly has two goals; it should target a) the YouTube algorithm and b) the viewer. It should target the former one because once you give the algorithm an idea about what is the video’s content, it serves the video to the right people. Video description is also for the viewer as we can provide people with some additional information there, but most importantly we can get viewers to do actions. If you're not a YouTube Partner, you cannot link info cards to your website, but you can always do it in the description box. It is also recommended that the video description would be at least 250 characters. 

How to structure your YouTube description?

Parts which change depending on the video content:

1. Introduction line

If you're on a computer, only the first two lines of the video description are visible before you click on “show more”. If you're on the phone or on a tablet, you cannot see the video description at all. Therefore, when you want to put something important there, make sure your message fits into those lines. For example, a very important link that you want to put up top and want everyone to see. 

Write just a regular English text or whatever language you produce your video in and write a couple of sentences.  Definitely use your focus keyword in your YouTube description; if you don't know what a focus keyword is please check out our video on tags where we discuss it in more detail (  

 • YouTube Tags: How to Get More Views W...  ). 

Essentially, a focus keyword is the main keyword you're optimizing your video for. Always put this keyword into the first sentence of your YouTube description and use it a couple of more times later when describing the content of the video. After this text, I would put everything that you mentioned in the video: specific links that you mentioned, resources, etc.

2. Content of the video 

Include time codes that link to a specific topic of your video. Time codes also give the algorithm a couple hints on what the video is about. But mainly it is for the viewer;  if they are searching for something specific, you might get longer watch times when people know that a certain part will come up soon. 

Parts which stay always the same: 

3. Short info about the channel/company/brand

4. Links to social media 

There are some more tricks on how to make your description boxes look even better.  First of all, make the separate areas visible. If you create a video description that is too long, it will get very complicated for the viewer to find anything. Also another trick for the description -if you want to track how many people click on specific links, use info cards and the end screen.
