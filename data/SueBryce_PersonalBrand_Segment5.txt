==== Start of Transcript: Personal Brand Segment 5 ====

[00:00:02] I say that the applause is for you for showing up to this class so that you can learn to be more, you know, you've got to be grateful for every step that you take every step that you take in this business, check-in always at any stage of your business that you're just taking a little moment to look at your own timeline and what you've achieved. If you've come from any of those money levels they talked about yesterday, and you've you're going up through those numbers. Take a moment to say, I have created the next step in my business already, and I know I can take one more, right? Take a moment to acknowledge if you were in survival when you started like me, and then you got to management. And now you're even getting to accumulation, but it's time to really thrive now.

[00:00:46] Take a moment to just celebrate that you have done all of this work, and most of the people doing this class are not just building a personal brand. They've been building a personal brand for 1 to 7 years, and now they just want real connection. They wanna make real money. They wanna connect themselves in their brand. They wanna go up a money level.

[00:01:06] This is about upgrading your self worth and upgrading the worth of your brand, so you upgrade both that they come up at exactly the same time. This morning, we're gonna keep creating timelines and really start defining what a path is to what we want. So the cool thing about manifesting, well, the uncool thing about manifesting is, like I said yesterday, it feels like a fantasy. But the truth is, is once you focus on something, you are in a state of manifestation, Once you focus on something with emotion, you're activating that manifestation, the creating of this thing. And here's something that you have to realize, even in your choices that you're making, like what am I going to manifest?

[00:01:51] Even in the path that you have chosen to walk, everything that you think about yourself will impact the success of this business, everything you believe about yourself will impact this next phase of manifestation because you can only ask from a place of value, and

[00:02:10] if you don't see yourself as valuable or you don't think you're worthy of having things and asking for them, if you truly don't believe

[00:02:18] that you are worthy of asking for the things that you want, they can't come to you. They just can't come to you. Now just like money energy, I just want you to look back. Now we don't need to go back. To when I was a child, and when dad was divorcing and controlling money and when mom was without and when we don't need to relive our childhood.

[00:02:42] You just need to go, where did this stinky money energy come from? Just take a look. It's okay. You're adults now. You know, your parents are not coming to fix it.

[00:02:51] We literally go into our old adult life waiting for our parents to come back and make our lives better because they ruined them in the beginning. No. This is your business in your life. It's time to stop playing old rules and old programming and those old limits and now start creating your own belief about yourself. Now listen to this.

[00:03:16] When a child grows up without self worth, it

[00:03:18] had parents who did not know self worth.

[00:03:18] A parent can't teach you what it does not have. A child that grows up without self

[00:03:30] worth, they struggle to find 2 energies. Do you believe this? Do you know what they are?

[00:03:31] Your goodness? And your power. Your goodness and your self power. Now, if

[00:03:44] you grew up with social curators that

[00:03:44] somehow took away your goodness and your power or somehow had none of their own and robbed you of yours, those are the 2 things you need to give yourself in order to ask for more. You need to see your goodness and you need to feel your self power because you are in charge of this, a child that grows up without self worth will seek validation from others and never measure up and

[00:04:14] never feel good enough and a parent can't teach you what they don't have, they can't teach you about abundance, they

[00:04:14] can't teach you about unconditional love, and they can't teach you about self value because they don't have it. Now, think of your own children. They don't do what you say. They do as you do. They watch you ask for money in equal exchange.

[00:04:37] They watch you. They watch you ask for things. They watch you honor yourself. They watch you set boundaries with other people.

[00:04:44] They watch you speak up for yourself.

[00:04:44] You're teaching your children all of this now So if you're sitting there crying about what your mom and dad did to you, then you're gonna teach your children the same thing. They don't do as you say they do as you do. One of the most, I think, impactful quotes I've ever used on stage is stop pretending that your children are going to have more than what you've allowed for yourself. I feel that down my back. That goes down my spine right to my feet.

[00:05:17] This idea that I need to ask for more so that my children can see me stepping up and receiving more, you know, personal power is the ability to build your self confidence. Now, like I said, confidence comes from action, not from vision. So when you start your vision, you're not gonna have any confidence It's only when we start to see it clearly, get lots of clarity, speak it clearly, and ask for it that we connect our heart, and once we connect it, I want this, then you're in alignment. That's when confidence is formed. It's formed in your solar plexus, after you completely, completely in alignment with what you want, you know what you want, you feel it, you can feel it in every cell in your body.

[00:05:59] Now you're gonna start walking towards it because you're just connected to this alignment. So that's where self confidence builds, and this is where you all so achieve all of your goals to ask for more, you have to believe that you're worthy of more because of the law of no

[00:06:13] more and no less. Now confident people are magnetic. Confident people are so magnetic in a room,

[00:06:21] you know, one of the we were talking about dating last night, and somebody said, I went on a date with a man that's not confident, and, they said something. And my husband said to me, you know, that's a bit cool. That's that was a bit harsh. And I said, you know what? Women are are bought up raised to believe that men just have confidence and we don't, so we expect men to be more confident than us.

[00:06:43] They have the strength, they have the power in the room, and we've come to expect that from them. But What is a woman's confidence? Cause the more confident a woman can become into a room, the more she needs attention, the more, oh, look, she thinks more of herself, you know, and so often, woman's confidence can be different. So just check-in on your confidence meter and know that you don't have confidence and vision. You get your confidence when you take your action, and I think that is just one of the most powerful things.

[00:07:15] Did you know if your goodness and your power come from mum and dad, guess what? Goodness is a euphemism for god. Thank goodness. For me, thank goodness I was born. I am goodness.

[00:07:35] You know, it it is the goodness inside you. It is Entias that comes from the comes from enthusiasm. Entias is the Greek word that means to have a god inside you to have the energy, a god like

[00:07:48] energy inside you, enthusiasm, connection, goodness. You are good.

[00:07:48] Now a lot of people don't treat themselves like they're good. And they start to get evidence that they're not good. And somebody says, you're not good enough, and you're not enough. And then that old programming comes in, but now I'm trying to get rid of these shackles so that you can start creating a timeline to what you want. Asking for more money, asking for more time, more support, asking for more, more, more.

[00:08:20] Find your goodness.

[00:08:20] Don't, for any moment, believe that somebody has told you

[00:08:20] that you are not worthy of something that you want in this world. I didn't finish high school. If I listened to every person say you will never be able to build a business, I wouldn't have built a business, hello, here I am. And the crazy part about it is, like, in hindsight, it so easy when you look back and say, wow, they weren't really telling me, they were just telling me their limits. And I was also attracting that because you attract what you don't wanna hear, right?

[00:08:57] I don't wanna hear that, and of course, that's what you hear. You're never gonna make it. There was also part of my spirit that is, I have a a bit of a hard time with authority. So when people said you can't do this, something inside me goes like this. Sorry.

[00:09:17] What did you say?

[00:09:18] You can't do it. And then something goes, just deep inside me goes like this. Watch this then.

[00:09:33] I just I can't be told that I can't do something.

[00:09:36] You tell me I can't do something, and I just wanna do it to prove to you that I can do it, but I'll do it fully

[00:09:44] connected because I believe in that. Now, I did my CliftonStrengths with Terry Hoffman, and you can reach out to Terry, but basically I did this test online that is your CliftonStrengths to find out your strengths. And it turns out in my top 5, I have command, I'm an activator, and I'm a cheever. So I basically run at a wall, hit the wall, and I'll

[00:10:06] say, okay, it's gonna work, but I'll run at anything first in full,

[00:10:07] in fear, in, like, low self worth, I will just charge it something that I want because I have those 3 things that make me, like, want to just activate on things. And that's part of who I am, and it's really good to find out what your most powerful strengths are because it's the only test I've ever done that told me what my strengths were, not my weaknesses, and you can obviously see the other thirty two strengths at your lowest point would be your weaknesses. And then you look and you go, oh, and to find discipline in

[00:10:45] my bottom

[00:10:45] 5, in

[00:10:45] my lowest, strengths, you're gonna laugh because today we're gonna talk about discipline.

[00:10:46] So finding your personal power means you've got to reclaim control over your life. And that's why when you're in debt, you're actually not in control of your life, and you feel so out of control that you actually think you can't manage your money, but it's only because you're avoiding it. So that personal power means taking control, taking control, not just of your debt, and not just of, but your path forward. In the money, steps, I want you to keep going up in order to go up and your money to the next level. Like, let's say I want to go from management, stabilization, I wanna go to management and, write and know how to do that, I've gotta take control of the management of my money.

[00:11:34] If you wanna go from management to accumulation, I have to take control of the direction of my money. Where is it gonna go? Where am I going to, direct this money? What is it that I'm working, remember I did my house, and I got my house? Now I've stopped giving a target to that bank account, and now it's doing nothing.

[00:11:53] It's benign. It's going backwards, because I've been taking money out of it. I looked at it the other day, and I was like, there is no active focus on this bank account, which means there's no timeline to the next thing that I want. It's that simple. All we're ever dealing with is that horrible, little emotional self that's always getting stuck in our brain, but once we get our emotions right, we realize that business is just commerce, and it's setting expectations, and it's delivering on promises and connecting to your clients, and going back to the magic of making what you make and serving how you serve and doing what you do.

[00:12:30] So it's about recognizing that you have the ability to make all of these choices for you, set all the boundaries around you, and create the business and the life and the income that you really want, you are in charge. If you feel right now that you're not in charge of this part, okay, then somebody else's. And if somebody else is in charge of your path right now, just check that it's not somebody that's meant to be helping you, that's keeping you from growing. This is one of the hardest things you will ever learn especially when you wanna start from scratch, and you need a partner to support you, and you need your partner to support you, and you give that best I can do this, you've got me, and they're supporting you, and you are all over the place. You're not making them feel safe.

[00:13:16] They don't see any evidence that this is working. You're chopping and changing. You keep going home and saying, Subrais said I'm worth this, but your partner's like going, well, cool. When will you decide that? When will you start saying I'm worth this because they start hating me because you're not doing it.

[00:13:34] So sort it out, man, like, you know, stop throwing me under the bus, start moving. That's the whole thing. Like, they're always like, that's super bright. And I was like, Well, if your wife listened, if your husband listened to me, they would be making money right now. So I always love when I meet partners, but I need you to know that it's not only taking control.

[00:13:55] It's taking control of your future path and then the connection to that timeline. You're in charge of it, you're empowering it. The more the focus, the stronger the connection, the quicker the timeline. It's that simple. So you don't need permission, you don't need validation, all of that is now gone.

[00:14:12] You have to understand that it is at absolutely pointless looking out at people and seeing how they're receiving you and what they think of you, I want you to come back to, I am so powerful as a giver that my focus is only what I'm giving and then asking for equal exchange. That is the most important part. I just wanna talk about this one more time. I don't believe unless you grew up with parents within credible self worth, that any children are brought up with a really powerful sense of self worth. To every degree they either get something mum and dad have gone through or they get the opposite of that.

[00:14:55] They're trying to push away from everything mom and dad gave them. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you grew up with money in your home or not. If you felt that a parent did not fully love and accept you, you will grow up with a feeling of not good enough, because who's gonna love you if your own parents who made you in their image cannot love and accept you. And to any human being that is felt abandoned by a parent in any way, shape, or form, this will directly affect your self worth your ability to ask for money and your ability to shine. Now, understand this.

[00:15:43] At the end of the day, not only could your parents not give you what they don't have, You are capable of outgrowing them financially, intellectually, spiritually, in every way, shape, or form, and you are completely okay to do that. Your identity does not exist in an umbrella under theirs. It is yours. You know, my parents grew up were brought up for very individual children. They were just like, you are what you are, go out into the world.

[00:16:17] Somebody said it's an oyster. That's it. My parents were like, I don't want you to like I said, I wanna leave school when I was fifteen. I'm not learning anything, and they both went, okay. I couldn't stay anyway.

[00:16:30] I'd had a a problem there. So it was just something like, my parents were just like, you'll go and find yourself and become whatever you wanna be. I understand I grew up in a home where I could come home with blue hair or tattoos or and my parents would be like, cool. So I was lucky. I was able to find my own way and become my own person, but a lot of people aren't.

[00:16:53] They're still living under this restriction that maybe mom and dad thinks this about them. And I was like, you're an adult now. It's time to let it go. If you can really push into 2 energies right now, you need to understand when it comes to marketing yourself, finding your brand, speaking your voice, putting yourself on social media, standing up at networking, presenting to people, teaching people, coaching people, becoming an industry leader, becoming a brand, you know, when you are you're starting to stand out in your community, you're starting to stand out your town and your city. And before you know it, you're just standing out to people, you're standing above other people, you're choosing that.

[00:17:31] If you didn't wanna be famous, and that's what business owners are. Everyone grows up in a small town famous, will everyone who becomes a business owner, becomes somebody in the community, You clearly wanna stand out and lead people. Why would you be starting a business? If you can hold to what is

[00:17:49] my goodness and what is my self power, then you

[00:17:49] absolutely can give that goodness to people, and it's inside you, but you have to see it. You really have to see it. You know, when you combine your goodness, right, with your power, then clearly, if I believe I'm good and I don't mean good at this thing, I believe I'm a good person, if I believe I treat myself good, I treat others good, I am good, then clearly, if I believe that I believe I'm worth more. And if you were growing up with this feeling like, wow, I didn't realize goodness or power was something that I needed to adjust in my life, but I have difficult parents. So now that you say that, I realized they have robbed me of a lot of self worth, and a lot of self power.

[00:18:40] And they've also robbed me, you know, of a lot of just opportunity in my life, because they did not teach me that I was worth more, because they don't believe they're worth more. That's their limit. You grew up with someone with limits, and guess what your mind is more. Your heart is bigger. You're already opening yourself up to the next level, and they're not.

[00:19:07] It's just what's happening. So you can just forgive it now and start to move with confidence. So I always say to people, avoidance behaviors, right, when we eat, when we drink, when we shop, when we do all the avoidance things, the bad things, the good things that become bad things. They always start off as as self care, okay, and they're they're actually that's not true. You think it's self care, it's stress relief.

[00:19:35] It starts out as as stress relief, but then it becomes it becomes an addiction. So we avoid whatever it is that we want to avoid, and then we become sort of these we get stuck on our addictions. Now look at all of our addictions, okay, the eating, the spending, they give us feelings, dopamine. Have you noticed each one of them give you a false feeling of fulfillment? You seek fulfillment.

[00:20:06] Now, fulfillment to me,

[00:20:06] was I'm seeking what I believe is just fulfillment, and it's translating into consuming.

[00:20:18] For dopamine. And understand this, the second you find fulfillment in making money and correct, you can find fulfillment in achieving your goals, not making money, I don't people are gonna rag on me for talking about money too much, but rag away. I made it. Let me show you how. Okay?

[00:20:37] So I'm not afraid of that judgment, and I am teaching a money class. I'm gonna talk about money all the time. You can be fulfilled by reaching your goals that are financial, Money does not fulfill you the goal in achieving it does, sort that out.

[00:20:51] Money is just a byproduct, love is a verb, and the byproduct comes the more I connect to the love of who I am, and

[00:20:51] what I do, and what I ask for. Trust me, there is no greater truth. So to be

[00:21:03] fulfilled in your life, to be fulfilled is to act with confidence, to be fulfilled is to live

[00:21:03] with purpose. It's to radiate your strength. It's the It's what you bring to this world. It's your power. You're strong and powerful.

[00:21:17] You know, I always thought to myself about 20 years ago, I made it a rule that whenever I walked into a room, my first focus is how much value can I bring to this room? How much value can I bring to this moment? How much value can I bring to the room?

[00:21:29] Sometimes I bring value to the room by staying quiet. But I acknowledge what bringing value to the room means and what bringing value

[00:21:29] to this moment means I I thought to myself, if I walk into every room and say, hi. And I bring this energy of like, how's everyone doing today? Hey, and I see everyone. And you look at people You'd be amazed how many people are living their lives, not connected to people

[00:22:00] walking, take control of that energy in the room, and watch everybody be like.

[00:22:00] You know, when you leave somebody, the best thing is a non physical compliment, when you're leaving somebody and they say, you make my heart feel light. I feel uplifted after I've spent time with you. It was energizing, just talking to you. Oh my gosh, I've I've I've I was really down when I came in today, and today, you're just like, you've lifted me and refocused me. And I made a promise 20 years ago, don't gossip, don't get stuck in problem focus, don't get stuck in drama focus.

[00:22:28] I don't want to know people's drama. I don't even wanna hear people's old sad stories. Because when you start to move people, like, come on, let's go. Let's shake off our trauma. Let's shake off our past.

[00:22:46] Let's, like, childhood, old programming. Okay. Get that a kick in the face. And then once you shake it all off, I like, cool, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna create a timeline.

[00:22:57] We're gonna get clarity on this next step. It's a big one. It's making you nervous. I can see the goosebumps. Oh, feel it.

[00:23:03] Okay. And, getting you all connected. And then you'll come up to me and you'll go, excuse me, man, I just have to tell you my story. And I'll go, oh, your story about how you're about to explode in a trajectory of energy and money and success? No.

[00:23:18] I have to tell you my trauma story. Why would you re empower that right now? We've just talked about where we're going. We don't wanna talk about where we come from. But you need to understand why I can't move because I have trauma.

[00:23:28] I was like, yeah, you do. So many people have trauma. That was in the past. Can you see how trauma is stopping you from moving forward? Deal with it.

[00:23:37] You've got to deal with it. You can't let it go. You have to accept they move with trauma, so it means that my

[00:23:42] filter is trauma. So when somebody rejects me, I'm more

[00:23:42] likely to feel a lot more trauma than you are. And then I will go and cry for 3 days, eat a pound cake from Costco.

[00:23:54] Fixes it every time. And then that's it. Right? And then you literally not today, Satan, and

[00:23:55] then you come back because you're in a sugar like void. And the truth is, is at the end of the day, you're just dealing with your own filter, in your own self, in your own past, and you have to get out of the way and process that in order to ask for more. Do you currently have a 6 figure business? Are you working towards a 7 figure business? Mostly I teach creative solopreneurs.

[00:24:21] I know most of my students have a 6 figure business. I know this because I have not coached anybody to a 7 figure yet, but there are currently 8 of

[00:24:35] my students who are sitting just below an 8 figure number, and they've been at this for 10 years, and I'm gonna watch one of

[00:24:35] them go over that 7 figure line to a 1,000,000 in income. Now if you're a solo preneur, just you. Just you. That's a personal brand.

[00:24:54] If you're a part time staff or contractors, wonderful.

[00:25:04] But you have to allow for them in the budget. So just you, as a solo brand, write down what you want your income to be next year. So you think about it, you want to make sure it's congruent to the path you're currently walking. So if you write three times as much, twice as much, there better be a path to it. Otherwise, you're going to fail at this at this, it's not a test.

[00:25:40] You're gonna fail at this example or this exercise before you've even started. And when you truly get that number, you're gonna look at it, and you're gonna go, okay. How different is that from the number that you're currently making? Write it down? Now if you have clarity and you tell me that you have clarity around the number that you want to make, but you haven't done your Thrive budget and you haven't written it all out, you don't have clarity.

[00:26:10] Go and do your Thrive budget and then come back and tell me what you want to make next year. Now that number is the goal, and it's not a willy it don't make it willy nilly. It's define it, be specific, Now I want you to deconstruct it.

[00:26:29] I want you to deconstruct that number.

[00:26:43] Where is it gonna come from? How many units will get you there? When you go to the creator calculator and you look at your product, how many of those products at your margin do you have to move to get to that number? We're just solving a problem. This is a game.

[00:27:07] You don't need to be scared.

[00:27:08] You don't need to say but how. I'm telling you but

[00:27:11] how. You gave me a number, you sell a product that's tangible manifestation. How many of your products do you need to sell in the next 12 months to hit that number? Is there a timeline to this money? Keep going.

[00:27:28] Work it out. Deconstruct it. Where's that money gonna come from? You don't have to do the hell. I'm telling you, you sell a product.

[00:27:36] I was like, okay, I could sell 10,000 of those. Then what would your goal be? If your goal was to sell 10,000 units, and that's it. 10,000 units, and I can get a $1,000,000 that might take me 1 year, that might take me 5 years, that might take me 10 years, give me the timeline to it. And that's what you're gonna make on the way, and that is your tangible manifestation.

[00:27:59] Cool. Because so many people come to me and say, I want coaching, and I say, cool. What do you want? And they go, I want what you have. And I go, cool.

[00:28:07] Okay. Well, I'm an educator. I'm a personal brand. I mastered a craft. I am a photographer.

[00:28:14] I'm a speaker. I'm an educator. I have products in all of those revenue streams coming into my business. Okay. Give me your path forward.

[00:28:22] Don't have one. Give me your vision. I don't have one. Your division. I want what you have.

[00:28:27] I was like, cool. How are you gonna do that? Selling what? To whom? And when they go Alright.

[00:28:35] I wanna be on stage, do you? Okay. Let's go. Send me a proposal and a video and a speaker real. Well, I don't have any of those things.

[00:28:42] I just wanna be up on the stage. Cool. Go away. Work on a talk. Film it, give me a proposal, no.

[00:28:49] That's not what they're saying to me. They want to pay me so I can give them the validation that they're good enough to stand up here, but they're not doing the steps to take it, and they're not creating a timeline to it, so it doesn't work. There's no timeline to this money, and if you truly are like, ah, I can't, I'm stuck, and they go, really show me the timeline, there's never a timeline. It means you're not connected to it, you're not actively walking, you're not focused on it, and you're not bringing it to you, not speaking it, it's over there, and you don't know how to break through. And if you don't know how, it's something you're doing that you're not facing, and that's just that simple truth.

[00:29:27] You know, very few people get to 7 figures. In order to get to 7 figures, I'm gonna walk you through my growth now, but in order to get to 7, you've gotta be selling a lot more than trading money for time, or you've gotta scale up with staff. Now, I scaled up to a 7 figure business with 8 staff, and I was only getting $50,000 a year. That's not scaling up. I was getting the same

[00:29:52] amount of money, and everybody else was getting paid. And, yes, I was making a I was taking a $1,000,000, but because there wasn't a profit margin for me, I

[00:29:52] was not making any money, so inevitably looked good on the outside was dying on the inside. How long will it take me to get to that income that I just wrote? Well, that tells me, why don't you tell me that? Why don't you

[00:30:19] put your current income? So let's say your current income is 160

[00:30:19] k, and you would like it to be 300. Yep. There we go. Almost double everything. We always do it.

[00:30:34] We double everything. We double everything. My goal

[00:30:35] is to focus on the

[00:30:35] timeline to that. Not the but how, the timeline. I know what I wanna sell. And remember when Sue said there are 5 ways to make more money in your business right now, number 1, increase your prices. Number 2, add more products.

[00:30:56] Number 3, drop the cost of your products. When you think about it, right now, you could even increase a lot of where's that coming from by simply activating

[00:31:03] those five steps in your business. So when you say, well, where's an extra $20 gonna come from?

[00:31:03] Simply a price rise. There it is. Fill it in. That's how smart you are. It's time to start thinking like a business owner, and not like a poor little needy meat sack that needs validation to make money, because this is what we are.

[00:31:23] We're just like, mhmm, can I do this?

[00:31:25] And then

[00:31:26] it's like, yeah, you can. I was like, can I really do this?

[00:31:28] And you're like, yeah, I can. I was like, can I sell this? And I was like, yeah, I can.

[00:31:31] I was like, oh, yeah. I can do this. You just focus on this number, and you start to create that timeline to it. So how long will it take me? How strong is your vision?

[00:31:45] How strong is your connection to it every day when you wake up? Cause, you know, if you woke up every day and went I create my day. Oh, goosebumps. I create my day. I create my business.

[00:32:05] I reconnect to my goals. I know what I want. I know who I am, I know what I

[00:32:13] do, let's go. Every single day, that's how I connect. And look, you can feel it in your body.

[00:32:13] You know, your intuition, your body is just constantly

[00:32:26] firing. It's just constantly connecting. Your gut instinct is unbelievable, and it will save you

[00:32:27] in business over and over and over again. Trust me at will. Listen to the feeling part of you.

[00:32:40] Listen to this part that honors you every single day. It'll tell you when clients are wrong for you. It will tell you when a path is

[00:32:40] not lit up for you. It will tell you when somebody is treating you with disrespect. Which means you're treating yourself with disrespect, and it

[00:32:54] will tell you when you need to set boundaries and resentment will remind you you need more boundaries, and envy will remind you that

[00:32:54] you need to ask for more. So listen to your constant feeling of, listen to that little voice. That's my thoughts and my feelings, listen to them, and then tell them to shut up, because you don't have to believe them. You just have to listen to them. So like I said yesterday, this timeline will change, so it's not a goal.

[00:33:25] If you say I want 300 k, that's not set in concrete. That's just like, I want to create a timeline to this number first. That's not this is what I have to earn, okay? Because this is gonna change as you start walking the timeline. The more connected you get to the timeline, the faster it starts to grow.

[00:33:47] What if you hit 300,000 in a year, and then you were like, clearly, I need a new goal? So this is a floating focus. It's not set in concrete. Now I'm gonna tell everybody This is what we do. I declare.

[00:34:01] I am going to make $300,000 next year. And your friends and family go, okay. And then you don't. And then they go, I thought you were gonna make 300,000 this year. No.

[00:34:12] You're gonna focus on a timeline to 300,000, because that's gonna get you more than 300,000. You focus on the timeline, not the money. You focus on the timeline to it. What do I need to do to get up there? I know exactly what I have to do.

[00:34:24] Activate those 5 things. Let's go. Reconnect to what I want, and say it every single day. So personal brands are typically between 6 and 7. And if you're just a solo preneur, I would love you to earn $300,000 a year.

[00:34:40] I would love that. So work out what your Thrive number is, Work out how many products you need to sell to sell your Thrive number, not how many products you have to sell for your income, just the income gross income into your business. Because remember, if your margin's 100, you're getting all that money, but you're only keeping 6000 for yourself, not not 18. So remember

[00:35:02] you're about to manage a whole lot of money in order to keep that special part just for yourself. Once you focus on that, you can grow your profit.

[00:35:03] So company brands, are when you create it business partners. Most company brands

[00:35:18] are built to sell. I built every one of my brands to sell because I didn't wanna call it my name. Not because I really built it to sell. Did I believe somebody was gonna

[00:35:18] buy my business?

[00:35:30] Maybe, but mostly I built it because I didn't wanna call it my name. So company brands can grow, but you don't really get to an 8 figure business without a structure of company around you.

[00:35:31] It's really quite incredible, This is probably something that I need to reiterate to you, because I've said it I said it probably three times yesterday. I have watched businesses start from scratch, struggled to make $400. The next year they struggled to make 1200.

[00:36:02] The next year this is per client. The next year they struggled to make 18 100. The next year they struggled to make 2a half 1000,

[00:36:03] but every year they went up one increment. Of income. And every year they push back.

[00:36:19] Right? I can't because it doesn't work. This won't work in my town, and I watch them learn the hard lesson first. This will work in your town.

[00:36:29] Other people are making it work, and then they get stuck in their ego in comparison. Well, I'm better

[00:36:33] than her, him. And then I go, no, think about it.

[00:36:33] Each increment that you actually go up in, you learn something more about yourself. You learn something more about, outgrowing other people who

[00:36:46] are not making as much money as you. You start to talk about money differently, and then your family and friends acknowledge

[00:36:57] that you're on a different path away from money, and they might shame you about it or go, oh, who do you think you are or, you know, because they are struggling with the fact that you're suddenly making money, you're about to change and you don't

[00:37:10] do that in, like, lotto wind increments. You do it step by step, putting those prices up step by step, taking one step at a time, because here's the thing about increments,

[00:37:10] it's the evidence. We are such ridiculous creatures. Do something you love, so you finally do something you love and still look out to see if everybody likes it. Work with purpose. I am working with purpose.

[00:37:26] Is it good enough? Build a business you love. I do love it, but do they love it? We're so worried about other people. But as you start to create this income, more money starts to flow in and suddenly you realize you're asking for more, Here's the crazy thing, asking for more is actually easy.

[00:37:58] You guys have already been doing it. You manifest like this. When you're down

[00:37:59] and out, all of us either pray or ask for assistance. In that

[00:38:08] moment, we say things like, I just need to get through this. And what do you get given enough to

[00:38:09] get through this? I just need to pay the rent, and what do you get? Rent, but you don't

[00:38:22] get food money because you didn't ask for food money. I just need to get to this level, and what do you get?

[00:38:23] No more and no less than what you are 4. And you're not asking for enough because only enough shows up. So when I started to learn this and apply this, I started to think, okay, I'm gonna ask for more. Cool. Well, I want $20 a week then.

[00:38:47] Guess how long it took that, to start happening in my business, went from $6 to $20 a week in a month, and maintained it for a year. And then I was like, careful what you wish for. I didn't say, and I would get paid $10 of that. So there I was asking for it, once you start asking for it, you're gonna be quite shocked at how quickly it turns up. Now you gotta keep it.

[00:39:07] And when there's no direction in connection, you're not gonna keep it for you. You're gonna give it away. It'll fall away, or you will give it away to people, because you haven't you haven't told that money what it's for. You haven't given it the direction and said, this is for my future health. You haven't said this is for my future trip to Europe.

[00:39:35] You haven't defined it focused on it and allowed that to become a thing, so if you don't define it and get that good with it, but once you do, you start to see the evidence that it's showing up, and then all of a sudden this feels good. I'm not struggling for money anymore. I overcorrect it. I call it the Daddy Warbucks. I wanted to pay for everything.

[00:40:03] I mean, why not? I'm rich. That's how I felt. I suddenly had this income. We'd all go to lunch.

[00:40:10] I was like, I got it. And everybody, everybody, my friends, everybody, even a guy I was dating at the time, they were like, Why are you paying for everything? I was like, yeah, because I can. I realized how people plizzy that was when I got to the end of it, and I said, give all your money away to your friends and family, and then see who will feed you and house you when you need it the most. And I realized I was giving it a way to show off, to give a feeling to to show this, like, look at me.

[00:40:44] I'm like, and it was a a sense of power. Making money gives you this feeling of power. So it's okay. You're growing in increments, and you're going to grow it. You're going to grow that value in you.

[00:41:00] You know, there's a moment, where you just start it starts working, and you feel like it's magic

[00:41:11] because you don't realize what happened in that moment, you're just like, what is happening right now? Now it's working. You can create those magical increments every year. It doesn't just happen. It's not one and done.

[00:41:23] That magic can grow if you focus on it, so let's focus on the magic. So, you know, everything you do enjoy and you start to see evidence and you start to feel good and you start to respond reinforces the timeline to what you want It also gives you more self worth, it gives you more connection, it gives you more focus. When you add more focus, you start adding more value, and all of a sudden more confidence, more money, and more joy. Because you are just focused on what you want at your full power, I say watch this timeline skyrocket. Before I did my creative life class when I set that big intention to be the 1st half a $1,000,000 workshop with Craig, I had already done the work on the timeline to what to that.

[00:42:13] I knew that when I set that intention, it was going to be a trajectory. I knew that because I'd done all the steps in the 2 years up until that moment. And when I stood there that day, I was like, this is the moment I have created for myself, I have a goal, I have an intention, I have a connection, I have a focus,

[00:42:33] I have the goods, I've practiced the content, I know it's good, and I am connected with

[00:42:34] my authentic voice because I am fucking nobody. I'm a nobody. And everything I was afraid of, uneducated, old, fat, irrelevant, who would listen to me, Kiwi exit, all of it came up, and I went, it's okay. It's okay. I'm all of those things, and all of those things make me just human like you.

[00:43:07] And when you realize that I was just like you, you were like, she did it. That's why when women of color

[00:43:15] succeed, children look at her and say, I can be her. That's why we do this.

[00:43:15] We do this for the for the little girls that want power

[00:43:26] and the little boys too, that people who want their own money can see somebody uneducated or, like them, succeeding and making money, because when we

[00:43:26] see people like us, That's why, like, don't get all of this wrong. You get up on the stage, and suddenly it's like, what am I wearing? And everyone's commenting on my appearance, and all my weight, and all my age, and do I get Botox? All of that is irrelevant to authenticity, The one thing I have to say is everything I ever did as an older woman or

[00:43:59] a woman that just owned the fact that I wasn't like this,

[00:44:00] like, bright shiny commercial thing, but I was just a real instructor was the fact that people resonated with my truth and my authenticity and that they saw themselves in me. That means when you go online, you have to worry about the haters, you have to worry about the people that are like you. That want you, that are your people, and that that's who I'm talking to. I don't care about millennials or genx or whatever they call them. I'm genx, genz I don't care about the young ones who are like, this is not how it works anymore, man, with their vocal fry.

[00:44:39] That's cool. They're they're gonna go somewhere else. I want women and men over 40 that wanna connect and make money, and and they're my people. I was like, so when people are like, Oh, but you're old, and you're the and I like, yeah, and I'm looking for people who want to who are like me. So I need you to put yourself out there knowing you're good enough to attract the people who are just like you, that want your voice, your energy, and and who you are.

[00:45:07] And, you know, when somebody I've always said this, okay, this is the craziest energy, but as a photographer, I got 3 photographers and I trained them to shoot like me. But when they would struggle in a shoot, they would come and get me into the room, and I had to walk into this room, not the photographer that they've met, not the one who's controlling the space, but clearly someone with command, and I'd walk in and do it in a subtle way. I'd be like, oh, what are you guys doing? Oh, this, and I would help without they would ignore me. They wouldn't make eye contact with me.

[00:45:40] They were like, I don't know who you are, but this is my photographer, and this is the person who's the most important. So when I'm really blowing up, I watch Nikki make connections with her

[00:45:50] community, and when she makes a new connection networking, people fall in love with Nikki, not me.

[00:45:50] So when Nikki says my mentor is super bright and they go, cool, but they're here for Nikki. So it's always the weirdest thing. I always say to myself, no, that's your people, and you attract your people, and I attract my people, and you attract your people. So who are your people? And every time you put yourself out there online, simply say, I'm talking to me.

[00:46:21] So if you're talking about business, talk about business, how you wanted somebody to talk to you 5 years ago. And if you're talking about self value, talk about how you wanted somebody to teach you 5 years ago, because all I've ever done in the 1,000,000 of dollars of content that I've written and sold in the last 15 years All I've ever done is written down what I went through, and it's like and then I was like, cool. And people resonate with it. It's a it's a crazy thing, and then it's a trajectory of how many units you can sell. You know, your long vision is important, and you can put a long vision there.

[00:47:04] But if the timeline of what you're creating is not achievable in the next year, you've made the vision too long, and you've made the timeline too long. And that's why there's increments because you walk in steps. You grow in steps, you unfold in steps, so creating a timeline to what we want is really creating the steps to it, not the timing. The timeline to what we want is irrelevant. Time is irrelevant on this timeline.

[00:47:35] It's simply a timeline of Nick steps. How fast you can walk those steps connected will be how fast you can get to the end of that timeline. Do you understand that? Do not make this as I'm going to give myself 3 years. No.

[00:47:53] That's timing, and those are rules, and that's not creation, those are limits. Instead, you were saying, I know what I want, and I'm going to create the steps and the timeline to it. So I want you to look at my increments of growth, because my increments of growth was so perfectly matching of most of the people that I coach.

[00:48:18] Alright. So in 2000 and 1, 2, I went freelance, and

[00:48:19] I made 25 $1000 a year, which by the way was exactly what my wage was the year before. How many of you started your business and made your wage in the 1st year? Hands up. Yep. Because when you come from a wage, that's exact what you do, you return to that wage mentality.

[00:48:42] That I worked out that really, really, really quickly. Then all of a sudden, I created my business in my garage, and I instantly got a business partner that gave me no equity, so she got a free free 50%, because that's what you do when you're dumb and stupid and you need somebody stronger and prettier to speak in front of you, and you hide behind them. And then I instantly got 2 staff because I made money, and then I went, look, I'm I'm dripping in money. I will surround myself with a team, and I will be important, and then they all got paid and I didn't. So the whole point of that was I worked out really quickly that

[00:49:20] I couldn't sell.

[00:49:20] I couldn't sell my work. Everything felt like selling, which means I felt not good enough, my work felt not good enough, and I couldn't say my prices. So the 1st 3 years, I learned how to breakthrough selling. The first breakthrough was getting to $1800 per client. The next breakthrough was 3a half 1000.

[00:49:41] The next was 5000. They grow in increments. My business grew very, very fast.

[00:49:44] I'd cornered one market. I had a product

[00:49:50] that was awesome, a service that was incredible. I had dialed it in. I had mastered my craft, and then suddenly I had a team of people around me that could sell it for me because I couldn't sell. I hid behind their selling as we made a $1,000,000. And it wasn't until I hit my rock bottom in 2009 that I realized I had never confronted selling in myself.

[00:50:13] I had paid people to sell for me. Does that work? Yes. It does. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in the long term, because what I'm attracting is I have guilt and shame, which meant my business made a $1,000,000, but I did not, because I could not keep the money.

[00:50:29] Do you understand if I could keep that money that $1,000,000 would have come to me not to all of my staff and everybody but me. It was only in that moment that I realized, in year 5, we hit $920,000 in gross income, I had massive overheads, a commercial lease, a business partner, and 8 staff, and

[00:50:52] look at my income, because this is the income trajectory of my business,

[00:50:52] and this is my income. And suddenly, I realized I had a business that wasn't working for me, but it was working for everybody else. Not only that I was completely wilting and dying in this business. I wasn't running it smart. It had too many overheads, It had too many staff, but those staff made me feel important.

[00:51:21] That business partner made me feel like I was worthy of making money, even though I wasn't selling or anything, they all taught me something incredible. And then one day I realized I wanted to die. I was wilting, and I wanted to die doing this job that I hated. Now that essentially was mine. I could have taken it straight back to my house.

[00:51:44] I could have gone back to my garage, got rid of my staff, gone down to a part time, makeup artist, and carried on as a photographer, creating 3 and a half $1000 a day, if not more in sales, and being completely happy, but I wasn't happy. I wasn't happy. I'd started this in 89. It was 2008. The time had come for me to do something different, to learn more.

[00:52:12] I was like, maybe I start a business, a franchise. And I instantly started studying franchise. Now it's 2009, and I realized, no, franchise is not

[00:52:25] the future. Online Education is the future. Alright. So I moved

[00:52:25] from New Zealand. I left my studio, I told them if I stay, I will die, they were perplexed, you just built a $1,000,000 studio, and I said, yes, and it doesn't work for me, because that's a lie. It made money. It just didn't make money for me. It didn't give me fulfillment, and certainly gave me no joy.

[00:52:55] So if I went to Australia, like I told you yesterday, hit my rock bottom financially, all my savings were gone, that was the moment I realized I wasn't doing it. I wasn't doing it. So if you are on the edge of breaking through this, I want you to know whatever you can't break through. You're not doing it yet. Doing it.

[00:53:18] You're talking about it. You might even be posting about it. But you're not walking the walk. And when you start to walk the walk, it will change you. You know, part of hitting that rock bottom that year was not only did I realize I wasn't doing it, when I started doing it, it moved so fast.

[00:53:40] Look at how my income went from rock bottom in 2009 to a $1,000,000

[00:53:40] in 20.15, but this time, this gross income was not, you

[00:53:54] know, for 8 staff and everything. Most of them were digital products, which meant my

[00:53:54] profit margin was significant. And it was only here. Now look at the steps I took to get there, because in 2009, I already had a digital pro sorry, 2010, I had a physical product and a physical service. I had no digital products and no digital service. In 2013, I added merchant, sorry, 10, I added merchandise.

[00:54:31] Okay. So you see how I jumped up, To instantly, a 160 k, I added merchandise, and all of this happened within 6 months of me doing my big declaration. So all of a sudden I went fully

[00:54:42] booked, I was on

[00:54:43] stage the which 10 x is your business, standing up on stage. And then all of a sudden, I went to a $160,000 by adding those cards. Now they were a physical product that I shipped. So I was making money while I sleep, and then I wake up in the morning and take my cards to the, post send them all out, which was a big pain in the butt, but it was making me money. Then because I was on stage, I decided to do in person workshops, and I opened 6 in person workshops and sold them out.

[00:55:18] Now, if you do a 6 in person workshop, I was, needing about $20,000 off those workshops, but I was also flying there with a couple of people and paying them, but I was still needing a lot of money but it's trading money for time. So once I got through 6 workshops, I now had a hundred people saying, well, we wanna do the next workshop, and I'm like, I'm fully booked for the year, I could not see them. They were booking me for photo shoots because they wanted also to connect with me as a provider of that, and I was just suddenly fully booked again. Now, so I add merchandise, I add speaking. Now, speaking doesn't get you paid very much at all.

[00:56:02] In fact, most, conferences will be lucky to give you a flight, 2 nights accommodation and maybe $500. It's not the money. If you get an agent, you blow up, and then you can be 50 to a $100,000 for the big talks, but there's very few people. It's you don't do it for the money. You do it for the audience, and you do it to convert that audience by teaching them so that they follow you home, not by selling to them, but by giving to them, just like you do your clients.

[00:56:31] So once I added speaking, that also exponentially booked my workshops, which inevitably booked my coaching. And by the time I got to 2012, by the time I walked into Craig's, I was already sitting at $320,000 in income for the year, because that was the question he asked me. How much money do you earn? And I said, this year, I will earn around $300,000, and he was like, cool. I said, I sell a physical product.

[00:57:00] I sell merchandise that I ship. I sell a physical service. And he goes, now you're about to create your first digital product. And it was then in 2012 that I created my first and then 13, my second

[00:57:13] digital product, and then 14, I keep adding digital products, and then it was right

[00:57:14] about there that my income got from $400,000 to $600,000 in that year, because I kept

[00:57:26] adding digital products to my income. I had one staff member.

[00:57:27] She's part time, and that's it It was the first time I turned around, and I was like, here, and I was like, okay, that's where most people wanna be. I wanna be earning 2.80, $300,000. That gives me a good, comfortable life. But when I started to add products, and I started to get up to $400,000, it was when I added digital products specifically, the more digital products I add, the more money I made. Then I got that up to $600,000 in income by myself, and then I built my own platform.

[00:58:07] Why? Cause I'm a sucker for punishment? Cottage, you have been happy making $600,000 and giving people all this? No. No.

[00:58:18] I need a platform.

[00:58:21] The

[00:58:21] thing is with the platform, is every moment that I've decided to grow more in my career, I've regretted it. Cause I've looked back at the girl that was in a garage just taking photos with love and I I look I crave her connection.

[00:58:41] Oh my gosh, she wasn't surprised. She was just someone that was singing for a

[00:58:49] supper. Every day I'd be like,

[00:58:51] what can I make for you? And how do I make you feel like a queen? And like, tell me about you.

[00:59:02] And I think of her Ah, and she was struggling for validation and to be seen, but she was so in love with a craft. I crave her. I crave the woman that was in that apartment, studio apartment in LA going look at me, I'm gonna make a $1,000,000 of income on my own, and this is an uneducated girl from South Auckland who was told she would never be anything. And why didn't I stay there? Because every growth period I realized was to build something bigger, and then be seen as bigger and more and become more.

[00:59:42] And the truth is is at any time you can actually stop and say, this is the income that will bring me balance in life without I need to be the next step, and I need to be the next step because it's very hard to hold your authenticity when it gets so big that you don't feel connected to it. And holding the authenticity of who you are was really, really a hard thing to do. So it was adding merchandise, adding speaking, you can also add reels or blogging to that. It will work the same way. I added an in person workshop, just another product to sell.

[01:00:20] I added on a one on one coaching. It didn't last long, not my jam. I added workshops. I added digital products, and by the time I added digital products, I was unstoppable. By the time I got to 2014, I had a revenue stream coming from all eight products you can make into your business because that's just smart.

[01:00:41] That is just smart. In 2015, I did my $1,000,000 a year, with my platform, and I realized in that moment that I've gone to a 7 figure business on my own. Now I've done a 7 figure business, company brand, but I've never taken a personal brand to 7 figures. I want you to know what it takes to get to 7 figures. You either have to have the content that's gonna go on mass when you look at that creative calculator, because you're really looking at the creator calculator of numbers, like how many units can I move and how many people?

[01:01:20] And if you have a timeline to that, then clearly, and and I had a path to that. Okay. But I'm also I out earn most of the instructors on those platforms

[01:01:31] by 80 to 90%, so I am an

[01:01:31] anomaly, or am I? You know, I've heard people say right place, right time, what, for the last 15 years? And I've heard people say she's an anomaly because, but I was like, am I though? Or did I just do the work? Cause I watched every creative live and said, I know what they're doing wrong, and I know what they're doing right, and I did everything they did right, and nothing they did wrong, and then I just keep giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and when people think I can't give any more?

[01:02:12] I always have more to give. I don't I can't stop. So that's part of replenishing that content and making sure that that content is rich and full. Am I anomaly or am I somebody that focused on that? Because I saw most instructors come onto that platform and say, I'm just here to build my own audience and get them to come to my workshops.

[01:02:31] And I'm like, cool. I'm here to make money and change people's lives. You know, they hand in hand to me, so it's very important. I do wanna talk about this. In order to get to an 8 figure business, you need a growth team.

[01:02:49] I got that platform to a 1,000,000. They got it to 6. It cost me 50 percent of my equity. Do you understand? People will work for you and start up for equity.

[01:03:01] But when your pie is worth $5 and you're writing $2.50 check, that feels good. Take this $2.50 piece of this pie. But when the pie's worth 6,000,000, you're writing a 50% check to those people, so you better be grateful for the fact that I wouldn't have got it to 6 without them. So for half for 50 percent equity to

[01:03:22] sec six times my business, that is significant growth. One of the most important things that I never want you to lose

[01:03:22] sight of is you are never to lose controlling

[01:03:26] in

[01:03:35] trust of your own name or of your own company. If you do, it's on you. How we grew this was we created a platform which was a library With that library became a subscription with the numbers you saw me project yesterday, but

[01:03:53] all of them came 10,000 every time. We added merchandise.

[01:03:53] We added live broadcasts because anything live connection brings more people.

[01:04:05] We added a conference. We added awards and accreditation. We added the podcast with our incredible host, Nicky Klosser. Nicky, how many podcasts have you actually recorded

[01:04:17] today? I think just under 300.

[01:04:21] That is a niche podcast. Something like About my business model. And it has how many downloads?

[01:04:28] Close to 3,000,000. 3,000,000.

[01:04:31] Do you know why? Because it's other photographers telling photographers the steps they took through all of this. And they differ, like, I did it Sue's way, and then I did it this way, and then I did it Sue's way all the way because it worked, and then I took put my spin on it this way. And all we've ever done is tell the story of people who have walked the walk. We're starting new interviews, a new show.

[01:04:53] We're interviewing self employed stories, not photographers stories, self employment, people that are built, platforms, 6, 7, 8 figure businesses, how they did it, where they come from. I wanna hear these stories. These stories are fascinating to me. So then we created a sister platform, right, because we just keep growing. And as you keep growing like that, you realize that you can't get to eight figures without people.

[01:05:19] So when people do their manifestation number, and I go, what do you want to earn next year? They go, 1.6000000, and then I go, Okay. What did you earn this year? And they're like, 25,000 and I go, cool. Do you have an only fans?

[01:05:33] Like, what are we dealing with here? Cause I I've gotta see this timeline And if people say to me, that's not manifestation, I go, it is. Do you know why I've done it? Do you know why I do it? Do you know what?

[01:05:47] It works. I've even had somebody say, the problem with you, Super Ice, is you teach people all about numbers so you give them limits. And I said, oh, trust me. I'm not telling I'm not limiting people. I'm trying to get them off the seat.

[01:06:01] I'm not limiting people to a 1,000,000 Oh, you're probably only gonna earn a $1,000,000 this year. But those are my limits. Okay? Do your best. It's not what that's not what we're struggling with here.

[01:06:14] People's limits are already set. I'm not giving them any I'm trying to smash through them, you can see that to get that at 8 figures, you've gotta jump through some big hopes of structure. So come back to this, look at that. At the end of the day, this is my brand, it's my personal income, If you start to look at this income over the next year is how you want to grow this income, I want you to create a path to it, and that's how you do it. Alright?

[01:06:41] Now, come back to this. Now remember your creation energy. First off, you're gonna put that money down, you're gonna say I'm gonna earn this much money. That's my goal. This is goal setting.

[01:06:52] Okay? And in that goal setting, you're saying I want it. And in that goal setting, when you write it down, you're saying I want this 500,000, this 300,000, this 800,000, And in it, you go, and I have clarity as how I can actually achieve it. There is clarity to me on how I can walk that path. It's gonna involve me doing stuff that I'm gonna be very nervous about.

[01:07:14] I'm gonna need courage and support, but I can see a path to it, because when I have clarity, I start to form a vision around it. That's when I'm like, okay, my vision is set. So I need you to go away, get clarity around that number, and start getting certainty and conviction that you actually can walk that path. You're gonna start to go, holy shit. Can I do that?

[01:07:34] Then you're gonna speak it out for the first time. You're gonna say it to Sue, you're gonna say it to your spouse, your partner, you might say it to a friend that you trust, or or one of your children, you're gonna say, I am going to make this much money. I'm creating a path to this much money. I'm creating a timeline to it, and you're gonna speak it out. And somebody's gonna poo poo it right in that moment because it's coming out of your throat chakra.

[01:08:01] And that's your power center. So if they poo poo it and you go like this, and you suck it back in, guess what? You just ate it. And if you ate it, you just sent it away, you canceled the request. To uncancel that request, speak it out again, and this time speak it out with more connection and more power, speak it out in a verb, instead of saying this is what I want, say this is what I'm doing to get that timeline to that result and watch me.

[01:08:30] How long is it gonna take me as long as I can wake up every day, fill myself with the joy and power and the focus and the clarity of what I want, and certainty and conviction I can get excited about it until I get these goosebumps and then I know I'm in alignment, and now I'm unstoppable because everything is just coming to me, and evidence is showing up, and I can see it, and it's working. And now I know I am in my full power. I am good. I am powerful. Okay.

[01:08:58] And you think it, and then every day you get up and you do it. You love it because it's commitment and you do it because it's congruency and there you walk and then you listen to your gut instinct every day and you honor your creativity, and you honor yourself, and you honor your feelings. And then every single day, and every time you get paid, and every time you have something great happen in your business, you risk receive it. And when you receive it, you receive it with gratitude because you say, I am getting something that I asked for. Gratitude is not happy, diffy magic.

[01:09:36] It's a prayer of love. It's a thank you. It's a I received the one thing I asked for. I wanted this, and you just gave it to me, and I received it because I asked for it. You gotta receive it.

[01:09:51] Otherwise, it will fall away. How much of this energy? Who feels like that? Who feels like I just spoke? Oh, when she says it, it's so exciting.

[01:10:07] This is how I feel. How much of that are you putting into your finances?

[01:10:12] Are you

[01:10:12] waking up every day

[01:10:13] going, you know, no

[01:10:13] guilt and shame, no avoidance, Let's have a look at the money. Let's set our money goals. Let's work out where our money's going. Where are we going on holiday next year, babe? The Bahamas?

[01:10:27] Okay. I'm gonna make a bank account for that. If you walk to your money like that every day, money would follow you. Money would be like, where are we going to the Bahamas? Where else on a cruise?

[01:10:40] Like, money gets so excited when you do, but instead it's like, nobody likes me. My work's not good enough. They're better than me, ego competition, and you're attracting from that place. So when I go back to this and I go, oh, yes. I see it.

[01:10:56] I think it. I love it. I speak it. I do it. I feel it.

[01:11:00] I receive it. I'm grateful for it. I focus on it. Money. Do that to your money.

[01:11:06] How many people are doing it to their relationship right now? What you most resent about your partner

[01:11:17] holds your greatest emotional need.

[01:11:19] What you most present about your partner holds your greatest

[01:11:31] emotional need. Who has said my partner doesn't support me? Who has said my partner doesn't believe in me? Who has said my partner doesn't believe I'm worthy of this? That is what you need.

[01:11:48] Your partner is not doing that to you.

[01:11:49] They are showing you the mirror mirror of what you are struggling with in yourself when you

[01:11:49] acknowledge what you resent about them you acknowledge your part in it, truth bomb. So when you really sit and connect with yourself and your own creativity, and they ask you, Are you fulfilled? Do you feel fulfillment in what you do? Because if you don't, you will seek filling. You will seek to be filled up with something else.

[01:12:17] Money doesn't give you fulfillment. Actually, that's not true. If fulfillment is that travel every year, then money will bring that travel, but don't say it's money. It's the travel. It's the family time and the ability to take your family to Italy, or do something that they will remember forever.

[01:12:47] What an incredible experience. So if there's no fulfillment, there's no focus, no connection, no

[01:12:48] energy going to it, and all we have to do is give it energy in order for it to light up. So what are you gonna focus focus in the next 8 weeks? I wanna, I'm gonna actually We'll stop there because I've got this next little segment, is really powerful to me, and I wanna just take our break because we're due for a break, and I wanna come back and hit this when I come back, because I wanna talk about discipline. I wanna talk about achieving your goals, and I've got a really different take on this than most people. And when you hear the way I achieve goals, you're gonna go like, Oh, okay.

[01:13:36] I think it might be a little different than how most people to the goal. So I'll keep discipline. Are there any questions regarding anything I talked about?

[01:13:44] There are. One question. Well, okay. We have two questions. I'm gonna start with the one that I I already know how you're gonna respond to, but a couple people asked about And that is how do you compete with

[01:13:56] other people who are providing services really talented people at a very

[01:13:56] cheap rate? How do you compete with that?

[01:14:05] Why do you care? They're not getting paid. They don't have a profit margin. They're not paying tax. They're not legitimate.

[01:14:11] What's your problem?

[01:14:11] They're judging

[01:14:12] that. They're not gonna

[01:14:13] get hired. They're worried they're not gonna get hired because they're just gonna hire the other cheap No.

[01:14:17] No. No. Focused on what they're doing and not focused on what you're doing. So you're just avoiding what you need to do. If you're better than them, go and be better than them.

[01:14:26] Who cares? Who cares? What Johnny's doing? Johnny's a dick? It doesn't matter.

[01:14:34] Your clients aren't gonna be pro your target client is not gonna be price shopping. They're gonna

[01:14:38] If you are looking at your competition, you're not creating, you're competing. This is about you. This is about you trying to be better than them and saying I'm better than them, but they don't even charge. So I can't charge. So you're saying I can't charge either.

[01:14:51] You you don't believe you're good enough, and you're putting it on other people. That's judgment, that's criticism. Who cares? Get out of your own head. Stop judging other people for how they make money.

[01:15:04] It's not your business. Why don't you go and make some money and show us how it's done if you think you know everything? Think about it. It's really confronting because That energy is it's resentment. You're resenting somebody else in what you think they're doing, and you don't even know.

[01:15:23] How who do you think you are? Come on. Get out of competition. Now that means you're stuck in comparison and self doubt and ego. Simple.

[01:15:34] Don't take that hard. I created my whole business that way until I learned. You can't care about what other people are doing. Look, even as a photographer

[01:15:46] that charged $33,500 a shoe, I can only photograph, at

[01:15:46] best, a 120 people a year, By live in a town of 3000 people, there's enough for others. But know all we

[01:15:59] can and that's what we do when we avoid what we have to do.

[01:16:08] We focus on what other people aren't doing, and what other people aren't doing. Okay. I think the bigger question to this person would be, what do you think that person is not doing? And if they say valuing themselves and charging more, then you can say then that's what you need to do.

[01:16:25] Another question is Meg asked, I'm getting stuck on products. What about those of us who have no desire to pursue the digital products in the podcast and the speaking platform? I just specifically wanna provide this one service.

[01:16:40] Then do it. Then do what I just did. Work out how much you wanna earn. Work out how many units you need to sell to do it. Work out if there's actually a timeline to it if you can scale your business to get to it and create that number, doing the one product that you enjoy the most.

[01:16:54] You don't have to open other revenue streams into your business

[01:16:58] if you are not connected to them. I don't like podcasting. You clearly know I have a problem with

[01:16:58] my speed I have a ability to hold a stream of consciousness for 8 hours. So that makes me not a good interviewer. Right? Cause I'll ask somebody a question and answer it and talk for an hour, and then they'll be like, It was great to meet you. And I was like, was it though?

[01:17:27] I learned this a long time ago. I'm like, I'm not for podcasts. So when the boys were like, we need a podcast, I was like, Nicky.

[01:17:36] And I

[01:17:37] I'll do it. And why Nikki was already podcasting? She'd already created busy as a mother. She was talking to mothers and women in business. So I was like, you're already doing it.

[01:17:45] I'm not doing it. Now can I podcast? Yep. Will I make money and be successful at it? No.

[01:17:53] Will Nikki? Yep. Do we pay her to do my podcast? Yep. Cause she's a way better interviewer than me.

[01:17:59] Also, she interviews me on my podcast, which is awesome, because then she asked me a question and I talk for an hour. See how I set that up? It doesn't as long as it's connected to you. The question that they just asked me was what if I don't want to be all these other things that you're talking about? Mhmm.

[01:18:19] And the pushback I get is from photographers, because they've taught photographers. It's, ah, so now all photographers are gonna be speakers. And I'm like, no. Just the ones that want to because change is hard for people and ego is hard for people, you can do whatever lights you are out of those eight products. Would I create more revenue streams as you grow?

[01:18:42] Yes. Because look, I created an tire revenue stream around this podcast and the revenue stream that pays Nikki, but it's not me doing it, but I'm still getting the revenue stream into my business. So I think that's really important.

[01:18:58] Okay. I just wanted to read a couple quotes. Some Frederica, she's like our little cheerleader for you. She's she's was encouraging people and saying, I've been a student of Sue since 2016, and she always over delivers every time. So if you're hesitant about signing up for the course, you can watch it on repeat in the 8 weeks of coaching, go for it.

[01:19:19] And Natalie said, I felt so much gratitude after yesterday for how far I've come, and I'm so excited for what's next. And that just made my heart. Whoo. So happy.

[01:19:28] Or some We're gonna take a quick break?

[01:19:30] Yep. We are. And before we go to break, I just wanna reiterate that you don't have to spend years trying to figure this out and alone in doing this by yourself. This is the course that will help you just have guidance you need to change your life and have more freedom and more financial stability and to do what you love. And, I mean, Sue's been my mentor for the last decade.

[01:19:52] 1000 of us have benefited from her guidance. So don't feel like you have to do this alone. You can get this course in the next 8 weeks for only a $199. That goes up after today. So make sure if you're gonna get the course, Get it today.

[01:20:06] And we will be back in 15 minutes with a ton more for the rest of our day.
