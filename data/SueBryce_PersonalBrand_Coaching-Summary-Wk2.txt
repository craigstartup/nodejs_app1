Coaching Wk 2 - Self Sabotage

Week 2 of this Personal Brand Coaching series delves deep into the roots of self-sabotage and the relentless struggle many face with self-value, particularly how it intertwines with financial mindset and personal growth.

I opened this session by expressing my passion for today's topic because it hits close to home for many, including myself. The journey to personal branding and financial independence is obstructed not just by external factors, but predominantly by our internal battles—specifically, our relationship with money and self-worth.

Reflecting on the progress from last week, where the focus was on financial understanding, I noticed a significant gap in questions related to money. This silence speaks volumes; it reflects the discomfort and disconnection many feel towards money—a crucial area we tackled headfirst today.

The concept I put forward is straightforward yet profound: “Money is the value metric, and self-value the personal metric.” If you can't ask for money, it's likely due to deeper issues tied to how you perceive your worth. This week, I reinforced the power of financial literacy as a tool, not just for business, but as a pathway to personal empowerment. Rewatching and digesting our previous discussions on financial management is crucial—it's about constantly revisiting learned concepts to transform them into ingrained habits.

Just as crucial as understanding money is the concept of self-sabotage. This destructive behavior often disguises itself as external blame—pointing fingers at the economy or 'unfavorable circumstances' rather than acknowledging and addressing the internal crisis. Understanding and working through self-sabotage is essential to build a personal brand that genuinely reflects your value.

I then turned to the emotional landscape that influences every step we take in life and business. It's about understanding that emotions are not barriers—they are indicators. They signal when we are misaligned with our thoughts and actions and act as a mirror reflecting our deepest insecurities and fears. It's only by confronting these emotions, understanding their roots, and aligning them with our true desires can we step forward boldly and consistently.

Another aspect we covered is the perception of self from others versus our self-perception. The mirror exercise I introduced—where participants identify traits they despise, which in turn reflect their own traits—was an eye-opener for many. This exercise serves as a powerful tool for self-awareness, pushing to acknowledge and adjust behaviors that hinder personal and professional growth.

Engaging with participants, I answered several queries, focusing on actionable steps to overcome personal hurdles, be it dealing with rejection, setting business prices, or prioritizing self in a world that demands constant giving. I emphasized that actions speak louder than intentions. It's not enough to want change; one must actively make decisions that align with that desire.

Wrapping up, I stressed on re-evaluating personal goals and aligning them with actions that lead to fulfillment and success. The analogy of monetary increment, treating savings as an investment not just in terms of finance but also personal growth, resonated with many. The drive home was clear: align your actions with your goals if genuine progress is to be achieved.

As we adjourned, the powerful sentiment remained—building a successful personal brand is an inside job. It starts and ends with how you value yourself and how passionately you're willing to defend and build upon that value every single day.
