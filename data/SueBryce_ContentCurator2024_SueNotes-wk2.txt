What is your superpower?
I can COACH anywhere in the world in my yoga pants! Some people learn by reading, some listening, some people need to learn in-person hands-on, and some people need step by step hand-holding, and that’s okay IF THAT IS YOUR SUPERPOWER.


I love to speak on stage (Keynote) and create marketing content and online education products; this is my superpower.


I do not enjoy coaching one on one or group coaching, and I do enjoy in-person workshops. In 2010, I was being asked if I mentored one on one, and I instantly made a COACHING package in the 3-7K range. I took my first 3 clients and PROMPTLY removed the package from my website.


Was Coaching a fit for me NOOOOOO And more important: Are we a fit? Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should!


Instead of hitting Social and saying I am available to MENTOR 6 people . . . Find the right fit and Mentor One person to the next level and watch the differences in how both those posts are received. Start doing it do it for free if you have to.


A Mentor/Coach creates accountability and connection, on-going steps of engagement and helps quantify their steps so they see their achievements.


What People WANT: Value + Content. (Meat + Potatoes) Service, Support, Guidance, Accountability, Community and Connection. Actionable steps and Quantifiable Results - (Especially online they need to SEE their progress.)


Ironically I saw the steps as Make a Product - Coach 1 on 1 - Coach a Group - Teach an In-person Workshop - Teach an Online Workshop - Speak on stage that was my progression every stage the audience got BIGGER and BIGGER.

MAP YOUR TIMELINE of Growth, for Mastery. Product, Income. Facts only. In linear order. TIME how long did it take to master that? How long did it take to create that? Build that? Grow that? How long did it take you to earn that income? Connect all the stories, the lessons, the knee scrapes, the smackdowns, the challenges, the achievements, the wins however small.


Know your story inside out and backwards and sideways.


That is how I breakdown content.


        1.        My areas of Knowledge.
        2.        My experience and depth of knowledge.
        3.        How excited I am to teach it, coach it, and create content for it?
        4.        How I want to teach, present, share it?
        5.        WHO I want to teach, coach, empower.


LISTEN… TO YOUR OWN STORY. Why? Because… The timeline of HOW you achieved anything, with the steps to walk forward, the evidence of how you grew, HOW you developed that Craft, Brand, Content, Product, Income, Business, Confidence is the most powerful foundation to build from. That’s Your Story?


Every Narrative has a Timeline. This is YOUR Experience + Timeline of Growth.


As you build this narrative… remember This is your Personal story, the path you walked to get here, It’s not a presentation and it’s not a creative writing class.


It’s for you to see your path. Don’t lie, you don’t need to. Let the layers unfold. Add more. Delete some things. Stay on point. This is so YOU know your story.


Start a Vertical Timeline. YOUR Timeline can be the last 2 years or 40 years. If it’s relevant to the content you are creating, your brand story, and your growth on any level then add it to your timeline.


Career / Business / Craft / Skill / System / Confidence. One Timeline for each or any that are relevant.


1: Career / Business / Craft / Skill.
2: Personal Income / Business Income.
3: Mastery + Growth.
4: Big Steps to Action.
5: Heart Narrative.
6: Confidence.


RULES Steps 1-4. FACTS ONLY. . NO FLUFFNON FICTION. Why facts, no fluff, no fiction? Because this is NOT a creative writing class, and if it was, 2 people would finish this exercise and 90 would not. It’s simply a LIST of Facts that details your path, your EXPERIENCE, and growth. THIS IS YOUR HOMEWORK.
