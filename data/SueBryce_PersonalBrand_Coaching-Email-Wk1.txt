# Coaching Week 1 Recap — Money!

We had an incredible start to our Personal Brand Coaching program last week, where we dove deep into the topic of money - understanding our financial standing and setting the groundwork to transform our relationship with finances.
 
If you missed the live session or need to revisit it, I've uploaded the recording so you can catch up and ensure you're moving along with us. Please watch it, take notes, and start applying these principles to see real change.

This coming week, we'll be focusing on branding and product creation, crucial for elevating your business and attracting more income. Your participation and openness in this journey are vital, and I encourage you to keep engaging, asking questions, and most importantly – take action.
 
Let's make the most out of this opportunity. See you in our next session!
