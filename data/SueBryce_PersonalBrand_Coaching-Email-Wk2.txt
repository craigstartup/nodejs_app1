# Reflecting on Week 2 – Self Sabotage

Thank you for joining me for another intense week. We ventured into the terrain of self-sabotage, exploring how our own beliefs and actions can unintentionally hold us back. It’s a topic I am passionate about because breaking through these barriers paves the way for both personal growth and business success.
 
If you missed this week's live session or want to revisit some of the points we discussed, I've uploaded the recording. Viewing it again might give you fresh insights and reinforce the change patterns we talked about.

Here’s what we covered:

Understanding Self-Sabotage: We discussed what self-sabotage looks like and how it might be affecting your business and personal life.

The Mirror Concept: I introduced the concept of the mirror – a way to reflect on how internal conflicts may manifest externally in your life and work.

Actionable Strategies: We went through specific strategies and steps to address and overcome these self-made barriers.
 
For next week, we'll be diving into branding and product creation. This is crucial for ensuring your business isn't just surviving, but thriving and attracting the clientele you dream of.
 
Your active participation is key, so keep engaging, keep questioning, and most importantly—take action based on what you learn.
