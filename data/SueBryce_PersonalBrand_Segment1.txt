This broadcast, you are clapping for yourself because you chose to be here today. And I want to change your life. You know, I always say, people say, you've changed my life. You've changed my life. And I'm like, you know what? I don't change your life. You change your life, but I change mine and I'm gonna show you how and inevitably it's gonna change yours.

I believe in this content so much I wanted to do it live and free. We're going back to old days and how awesome is that? Um, you know, this is a powerful workshop and I want it to move your needle, and I want it to change your path forward. So let's get started. Your brand, the number one pillar that you are building around you is your brand.

And your brand is your face value. Now, if your brand is your face value, that's what you're putting out to the world, who I am, what I do, and who I do it for. It's one of the most scary, terrifying things you ever do in your life, and it's called putting yourself out there. Now I'm specifically teaching a business class.

This is a personal brand class. Why did I call it personal brand? Personal brand is the future. If you are a solopreneur, a creative, if you're a designer, a photographer, a coach, you have a personal brand. If your name is on the door, this is a personal brand and personal brands are the future. Moving forward.

Now, I coach personal brands, and now I don't just coach creatives, I coach doctors. I coach a lawyer. I coach a plumbing business because people are standing up in their brand because why? Social media has changed. The world has changed. We used to hide behind our brand name and now we've gotta put ourselves up and out there, and that's why we've got to create this personal brand.

Now, you will not create a personal brand until you get clarity. And clarity is what we are looking for in this entire pillar. When you create your brand, you are looking for clarity. And that is being able to communicate who you are, what you do, and who you do it for. So make no mistake about this. I nearly called this workshop Love and Money because this workshop is about love and money.

Why? I have built a personal brand through six, seven, and eight figures. I did that with love and money as my center. Love and money was what I wanted. I wanted more love. I wanted more money when I first started out. I soon worked out. The more I loved this path, this business, the more I loved and valued myself, the more I loved and created the actual path I want, not what I thought everybody else told me I should do.

My value increased. Everything increased. This is what you need to understand. Love is a verb and money is a byproduct, man. And when you are. Apply those two energies to your business, you will win. You know, before we do anything, this is how deep I wanna go. I don't care about your surface level, I don't care about your logo.

A logo never booked a client for me. Logos are a waste of time and a waste of money, but that won't stop you from creating one. Logos are ridiculous. I would rather you spend your time on you and building up you than a logo. But at the end of the day, when you sit in front of me as a coach, I don't care about your color scheme for your brand.

I don't care about the font you decided to use. I don't even care about how you write your bio, when I care about when I'm coaching you, and I wanna move you. I wanna move you in your income. I wanna move you in your business value, and I wanna move you in your self value. The first thing I'm gonna ask you is what is your path forward?

And when I'm coaching you, you have to look me in the eye and tell me the path you are about to walk. And if there is no authenticity. And what you are saying to me in that moment, I can see it and I can feel it because it is palpable and I can tell you are lying and I can tell you are on the wrong path.

Now, this is my superpower. I'm intuitive. I read body language and micro expression, 35 years of photographing faces. I know everything there is to know about micro expression and when I see people telling me about their path forward and it's not connected to love or money, I know you are out of alignment and you are walking in the wrong path.

So the first question I'm gonna ask is, are you walking your right? Correct. True path right now. And if you've started a business and you might even be 10 years into it, but it's just not connecting and it's just not growing and it's just not flowing, it's just hard work. Then do this test. If you are starting out with a whole brand new dream today and you haven't even taken a step towards it.

You just think, I'm gonna go and watch this workshop and see what dream forms for my future brand. Do this exercise. If you are burned out, do this exercise. If you feel like you're on the right freeway, but in the wrong lane, do this exercise. And the reason I do this exercise is I've been doing it for 25 years.

Whenever I talk to anybody, I just randomly do this exercise and it's the craziest thing. So let's do a test to see how connected you are to this new brand or this old brand. Or maybe you're just in the building phase, or maybe you are actually wondering what your real purpose in calling is. Let's do this test.

I call this test the one. Million dollar dream, and it's a really weird thing if you've got lots of money. $1 million is not a lot. You can blow through $1 million quickly. We all know that $1 million will buy you a great house in the middle of America, but on the outer edges it's going to be a good deposit.

We know a million dollars doesn't actually move our needle that much, but it actually does. Because anybody who's in debt, anybody who's struggling, anybody who's living month to month, managing their money, stabilizing their money, but not accumulating $1 million will change your path. It will change your life.

It will change your path if you allow it. Listen to why. If you truly, if you truly think about this energy, this million dollars, I'm about to gift you a million dollars. But it comes with a rule. The rule is you cannot use it for anything but this new business that you are creating or the business that you are restoring with me, okay?

So you can use this million dollars solely for that business. You need to write down if that million dollars is paying off any debt. 'cause if it's paying off debt straight away. That's your number one problem. Write that down. That million dollars will change the way you work, but will it make your ship go faster?

And what do you want to do with the million dollars? I need you to spend time with this. Like sit with it. Sit with it for days. Sit with a piece of paper in front of you. Sit there and say. What would I do with this money? Imagine you are creating a budget for this money and it's gonna feed your business for a year.

What's it gonna buy? What do you need right now in your space or on your online space? What do you believe is missing that this money will pay for? What opportunities do you see will come to you with this money? Acknowledge. This feeling that if I have that money, there'll be no more stress, no more ebb and flow of income.

That makes me feel constantly sick because it's just not flowing to me. And what would it alleviate? What would it help You can't help anybody else. This business is for you. So this business, that million dollars, it's not to give to your family. It's not to give to your children. It's not to make anybody else's life better, it's only for your business, and I want you to spend that money in your business.

I want you to connect and spend time considering if you are actually doing everything on this list or if it's completely removed from the path that you are currently walking. I do this test with people. I've made a check. This is my check, and this is in the PDF download for when you get this class in this check.

You can print it and you can put your name on it. There's something about this, there's something about holding it. I tell people to close their eyes. I might go off camera for a sec, but you know, I'm here. I tell people to close their eyes and receive this million dollars. I tell them to feel it. I tell them to feel what it feels like to be given this gift.

I want you to put your name on it. I want you to sign this check. Uh, it's signed by me. Don't cash it. You might get arrested. This check is powerful. It solves problems. It changes all of the things that you think are in the way. It gives you opportunities you thought you didn't have. It's for your business.

It's to make your business better. For those of you out there that are not holding a check, hold a check, hold a piece of paper and close your eyes. Think about it, man, God, what I wouldn't have done if somebody had given me that I could have had everything I wanted in the first year,

but I couldn't because you do with money. What you do with money now. And if somebody had given me a million dollars in my first year of business, I would've done with that million dollars what I was doing with money at the time. I would've destroyed it. I would've spent it. I wouldn't have valued it, and I wouldn't have given it any direction.

So until you change something, someone giving you a million dollars means nothing. You know that TV show move that bus. Google, how many people still have their house in a year? You know, average lotto winners ask them how much money they have in one year. It's gone. Because if you don't learn about money and you don't know what to do with money, you don't value it and you have no direction for it.

You simply can't create it and you'll just consume with it. It's how it works. So this million dollars, it's a dream. And it shows you what you really want. It actually helps you get to the core of, well, if I had that money, and the Banco certainly wouldn't be doing that job. Yeah, right. It shows you how far you are out of alignment from what you really want, and what you are going to hear over the next two days is what do you really want?

So what you really want, you are then going to. Get a vision for it and create a timeline to it. And when you create a timeline to something, it will come to fruition. And I'm going to teach you how to do that. But the first thing I need to know is, is this a clear path for you and is this a true path for you?

And when you tell me, I know when it's not true. The most incredible thing that you can do for your brand, your business, and this million dollars is to create a vision. Create a vision with it. Like go beyond what this million dollars will alleviate, and I want you to start to create a vision for that money.

I want you to literally look at it and say, what vision am I going to create for this money? I wanna introduce you to the multiverse. The multiverse is about creation. It's about when you create anything in your mind, I want you to understand what the multiverse is. The multiverse is like sliding doors.

It's the one day you could make a decision and it will change the course of your life and business. And when you're in the multiverse, you get to imagine all of the paths you can walk. And you are just imagining them. Now, the multiverse is the most powerful place to visualize because you are just following a thread.

What if I got that million dollars and opened this business instead of this business? What if I did that and told everybody? And you are just exploring the idea of it in your mind before you tell anybody. You know, they say, don't share your vision. Because when you get to share your vision, you get division, right?

Because as soon as I share my vision, you are gonna give me your limits. You are gonna give me your ideas. You are gonna give me your rules, you're gonna give me your opinion. You are going to tell me if that's not possible. And as soon as all of that happens, I start to lose connection to what I want. So the multiverse is where you can explore every path.

Imagine yourself completely different. Imagine yourself living in a different country. I do. It. Imagine yourself doing something else. Imagine yourself surrounded by different people. It doesn't matter. The multiverse is to explore. And when you explore, you understand I can create my future path because I'm looking for the path that lights me up the most.

You know, there is no competition in the creator room, and comparison is self-doubt. Inflated ego is a fear of rejection and envy is assigned to write a list. Now, I coach businesses. All I'm managing is people's comparison and self-doubt. I go, this is how you do this. This is how you build a business. But what if I am not good enough?

Okay, that's comparison and self-doubt, and I thought you were building a business with service and purpose. Oh, but it's about me. And then we get stuck in our inflated ego and our fear of rejection. I can't do that because I'll get rejected. People won't like that. My family won't like that. Most people do not become an incredible, powerful personal brand because their friends or family or spouse told them they shouldn't, couldn't, can't, don't.

Because that's their limits. Well, somebody told me my limits in 2010 when I came to WPPI from Sydney, Australia to attend that first ever first conference. I saw 74 speakers on the stage and I said, I want that. My friend said, everybody wants that, and she poo-pooed it. And I looked at her and I said, those are your limits, man.

Those are not mine. When I said that, I did not say that of the, with the confidence that I'm standing here right now. I said it more like this. Well, those are your limits and they're not mine. And clearly they were mine. 'cause it was upsetting me that she said I couldn't do it. And I remembered thinking, why can't I do it?

Why? I have a great business. I have a great story. I have so much to share. Why can't I do it? Aren't you sick and tired of fighting against this invisible barrier of you putting yourself out there and being successful? Guess what? It's you. So that's it. I realized in that moment if I got out of my comparison myself, doubt, and decided to walk the multiverse to see the path that I wanted, if I can get out of my ego, which is just a fear of rejection.

And if I could listen to the voice of Envy inside me, why are they up on stage? They're not even good speakers. Why are they up on stage? They're not even good photographers. Why are they up on stage? They don't even make any money. I heard the judgment that was inside me looking at those other speakers, and then I said, well, if you think you're better than them, maybe you should get up there and do better than them.

And I realized I was in envy. And envy is a call to action. 'cause it means you want something. So I sat down instead and I said, I want that. And you know, the next year I was booked on that stage. And that was the beginning for me because I just walked that multiverse and I asked myself, what is it that I want?

If you feel competition, you are not in the multiverse. If you feel your ego, you're not in the multiverse, you're in your mind just thinking about how other people are better than you, instead of being a creator in the in the multiverse. I don't have time to worry about what you think of me, what you don't think of me.

I only have time to give to the people who want to connect with me and hear from me and learn from me. Wallace d Waddles. I am here to create. I am not here to compete for what is already created. As soon as you go into a competition mind, you have stopped being in a creation energy. There is no competition in creation.

I guarantee it. A lot of the times around me, and you'll see this in multiple classes, I talk about doing your three by three. What is your three by three? It's ownership. It's the most powerful way to say who you are, what you do, and who you do it for. My name is Sue Bryce and I teach workshops. I teach workshops in person and online about self value, content, curation, and business.

That's my three B, my three by three. I know who I am, I know what I do, and I know who I do it for. So, you know, for those of you that have not heard of the three by three before that want to do their three by three. We are going to drop a link in for homework so that you can do that, because that link is also on my website and it's easy for you to get hold of, but I want you to do it because you need to be able to stand in front of me, look me in the eye, and give me your three by three.

And I want you to know that it's the truth. You know, the most powerful energy that comes out of a human body is authenticity. Everybody thinks it's love or hate. Or rage, and it's not authenticity actually registers a lot higher than those three very volatile emotions. And the most incredible thing about authenticity is it's the truth.

It's your truth. So when you speak a three by three to me and there's not enough truth in it, it sounds like bullshit because it's not the truth. When you have built a business, that's not the path you really wanna walk. It's not the truth. It's not your truth. If I do anything today, I want you to come to the understanding if you are on your true path or not.

And if you are not, please don't be afraid. The whole point of being here is that I'm waking you up to it so that you can shift gears. It's that simple. What is your brand story? We are all brand owners. We're all building brands. What is your brand story? You know? And when you really sit down and say, what is my brand story?

You know, is it I made this, I created this, you know, I built this, I overcome this. What is it? When you think about how you tell your brand story to the world. What is that brand story? I discovered this, I learned this, I mastered this. Like, what is it? I fought my way through this tooth and nail. Your brand story is there and it's so, and it's going to resonate with so many people, but you first have to see that story as important.

You've all heard my stories. For those of you that have coached with me, you've heard some of the most powerful transformation stories of me building my brand. And they were simple. They were simple stories. Stories that just one simple thing just moved my needle exponentially and I just knew. So I really want you to understand why your story is interesting.

You know, for some people they're in business just to make money because that's actually their connection and their motivation. There's a lot of people out there that wanna learn that, that wanna connect to that, that will be attracted to that because they see you as somebody that's building systems wealth.

You know, it doesn't matter what your thing is. You're going to attract people because ultimately finding out that brand story. Now, the most interesting thing about people is you're trying so hard to be validated with your brand, which is your face value. You've stopped communicating who you really are.

You've stopped communicating where you've come from. You've stopped communicating what you've been through. You've stopped communicating to anybody about who you really are and what connects you to this business. So personal brand, the content. You are the brand. You are the face. You are the voice. So, you know, think of your content, think of your marketing content.

Think of how you've written text on your website. Think of your words. Think of your connection to this product. Think of your service. Think of the experience people have, what with you? And think about that connection now, that connection. That connection right there. Is going to make you a lot of money and a lot of people don't have it.

We don't have a connection with our brand story and then we haven't connected to our clients what it is that we really do for them. 'cause we are so busy trying to be seen by them and have un validate us and tell us we're good enough. So look at this. Look at what we buy in the world. Look at what we buy.

Look at what we value. The number one book purchased in the world, $14 billion last year was spent on fictional romance. We dream about love, we fantasize about love. If you are thinking of writing a romance book, get yourself into that $14 billion immediately are. Romance novels. When I read that, part of me went, uh, and the other part of me went, oh, oh, we would much rather read about fantasy love than put it down and connect with a loving relationship with the person we are most resentful to.

And I was like, wow, that's fascinating. Looks, look at nonfiction memoirs. Number one, memoirs and autobiographies. Why? Because human stories is where it's at. We wanna connect with love. We wanna connect with stories, right? Religion and spirituality. We wanna know that we are good. We wanna, we want to, we want to connect with faith.

Number three, self-help for business. Because once you get through all those business stories and autobiographies, once you connect to your faith and what you want, once you start to read self-help books where usually are about love and money, you realize you want more, so you start a business. That's how it works.

And the most awesome part about this is cookbooks is number five. You gotta eat. And you gotta have family, man. 'cause when we feed a family that is community, that is family, then we buy books about money. 'cause we are frustrated. We are frustrated now we've heard the stories, we've connected to God.

We've tried to help ourselves. We've built the business. Now we're cooking for the family, but the money's just not coming. We better go and buy some money. Books now. Money books. Comes up in number seven. Next minute you start making money, you realize you're so exhausted from creating the first six steps in your life.

You probably need to go to the gym, work out, balance yourself better because you are what burning out. Yeah. That's usually what happens throughout here. We start burning out, then we work on our body and then we work on our fitness, but then we're making enough money that we should travel more and then we start traveling and then, hey, when you've got everything.

And you're not stressed out anymore, guess I need a hobby. And as I went through it, every year it shifts and every year there's a different need. And self-help gets lower in some years. And self-help went higher and money went right up to number four at one point. But the first three, the first two, don't change.

The first two. Don't change. And that ultimately is what we want. We want to up upgrade our lives in all of these areas. We want to enrich our lives. We crave connection and meaning and belonging. And you know, you are personally connected to each well. You are personally collected to some of them. Which ones, which one do you look at right there?

And you go, I am Perdu, I'm person. My brand can personally connect to how many of those themes. Because this is how people want to talk about, listen to this. My three self-help business and money. Okay? Self-help business and money. 'cause those three areas. When I changed those areas, my life changed significantly.

So those are my jam. Now, I've spent 25 years as a working photographer before I started teaching. I can relate myself to most of that list. I can relate myself to most of that list, but it's the one that I'm most drawn to. Okay. That is the connection to me. So look at that list again, think about each one of those areas and go, oh yeah, I definitely belong in that area, because that tells me if it's connected to you, you are going to find a way to connect it to your brand.

So I'm a photographer, so I have intimate conversations with women. I have had intimate one-on-one conversations about self value and self-worth for 35 years. I have talked about body image and confidence and putting yourself out there just as a photographer. I am a walking self-help book. I have photographed over 6,000 women.

I wrote a book about it. I created a, a confidence and self-worth workshop in 2001 and two people came. It was like I knew back then what I wanted to do. It was infused into my brand because it's infused into me. And when you can't find your connection, you can't find your fulfillment, you can't find your value.

Business and money for me. Business was how I worked out how to manifest, but it wasn't manifestation. I was selling a product around me and filling it with value. That's tangible manifestation. Business and money changed my life and that's why I love teaching it. I built a six. Seven and an eight figure business and sold two companies.

I could teach money all day every day because these subjects, they thrill me and they were my biggest learning curve. My biggest learning curve. You know, I could not teach money or business until I paid off my debt and created a sustainable income, but when I walked that path, once you've walked it, once you've built your business.

You've done it. You don't need to qualify yourself anymore. You don't need to tell people that you're qualified anymore. You're doing it, you've done it, you're done. You created an income. Now you're managing that income and scaling that business. You don't have to. That's it. Stop with the next level and am I good enough and next level, and am I good enough?

Every time I mastered something, I knew I could teach it. Everything you create in your brand will belong to one of these four words. It's that simple. Everything I do is education. Because education sells. These four things sell. We want to education, we want to be empowered. We want engagement and community, and we want entertainment.

This is what we spend money on because all of these things make us feel good. So if those other things. They connect us and these ones make everyone feel good. Then you're gonna look at all of those areas and themes and say, which ones am I most connected to? Which ones, uh, which ones am I using in my business right now?

And use this slide in your marketing. Put this slide in your office on the wall, print it out and say everything I write to my clients, is it educational? Is it empowering? Is it engaging? Is it entertaining? Does it connect? Is it for them from me? You know, I say that self-help, self-worth and self value are my jam, and I know that when I teach it, I can teach anything through a filter of that energy.

So how does being a photographer, let's say good example, connect me to these things. Do you know why? It's me, it's connected to me. That's an authentic connection. So clearly I, when I was at the height of my photography career, in the beginning, I was a competitive martial artist, so I would turn up to photo shoots with big black pressure bruises all the way down my forearms.

That did look kind of a little scary for some people would see the bruising and look away like, oh, is she being beaten? No, but she was dishing out some beatings. It didn't take long for me to say I'm a martial artist, but you know, that's what you do when you're obsessed with something. You talk about it.

Some people would be like, wow, that's impressive. Others would be like, cool. Mostly people would be like, oh, oh my gosh, so am I. Or so is my son, or so is, and it didn't take long for me to relate what I was doing. To being a photographer because I'm connecting with people. But the one thing you need to understand about this connection that you are now looking for, all of those subjects that you are connected to is, is it truly connected to you?

Because if it's not authentic, people will feel it. But when you have an authentic connection to one of those areas. Watch people get magnetized to you that are exactly the same as you, because we attract clients that are like us. Have you noticed that we attract people just like us and our business because that's what we are attracting.

So in marketing, we say sell everything but the business, doesn't it make sense that you would be connected to all of those areas? That you have some connection to all of those areas, because if not, you're really just telling people over and over again that you have a product and they should buy it. And that's not marketing.

When you create connection, uh, it's called selling on the periphery. It's not direct selling. It's like, wow, I totally was drawn to that person to work with them. I connected with them because we're so alike. They do this also and work in this field, and I also do this. You will be amazed at when you start to share yourself, how many people will be directly attracted to you.

So in marketing I always say market to what people aspire to be. Okay? Think of it. This is aspiration. When you think about what you do as a business owner, when you think about how you create as a business owner, and when you think about what you give people, how you serve them, what do you think they aspire to be in your brand?

What do.
