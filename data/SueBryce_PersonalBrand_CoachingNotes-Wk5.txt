I teach workshops, in-person and online, and this is my greatest passion. I help people find their voice, self-worth, and true path through their gifts and craft. The most transformational time of my life—personally and financially—came when I began building a brand around myself. 


My journey as a solopreneur has been richer than I could have ever imagined. Not only have I learned to achieve financial independence, but I’ve also discovered the power of helping others transform their lives.


Deep inside, you may feel a calling to take the next BIG STEP in your business. I’ve felt that same calling, even through stress and uncertainty. It never grew silent—it only became louder. Let me show you how to unleash that voice, find your greatest value, and become the fullest version of yourself. So you can build a sustainable business around you.

Bullet time


Make a list of all the main points you need to hit.
No Fluff No stories just facts and steps.
Put that list in linear order of flow.
The main points become the slides. Each slide can have notes
5 mins - 5 slides (750 words don’t read your keynote)
20 mins - 10 slides (3000 words) Ted Talk 13 mins
Flip your bullets / add notes / add a story / add social proof
If you have visuals add data / add a before and after
Practice - Breathe
