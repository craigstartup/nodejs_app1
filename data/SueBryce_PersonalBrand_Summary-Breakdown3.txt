Segment 3 - Money is Your Value Metric

In this segment, I delve into the concept of tangible manifestation and the importance of understanding and structuring Thrive and Survive budgets. The crux of my message centers around confronting and navigating the emotional landscapes associated with personal and financial growth and recognizing the empowering journey of creating value-based exchanges in one’s business.

Manifestation often feels like an elusive dream to many, something intangible and fantastical. Yet, through my journey, I’ve learned and shared that manifestation is not just about conjuring dreams—you have to act, plan, and price your work properly. It is necessary to manifest tangibly, which means breaking down your goals into precise, actionable steps, understanding your costs, and determining the value of your effort and output.

Addressing the emotional barriers that hinder financial planning is crucial, especially when developing a Thrive budget. If you are overwhelmed by feelings of unworthiness, guilt, or a lack of entitlement, these emotions will sabotage your ability to envision and execute a financial plan that facilitates growth. In my early days, recognizing my value was a pivot; I discerned that charging for my services was not just about covering costs but about valuing my expertise and time, which are priceless.

During the segment, I emphasize how often people unknowingly disempower others by simply providing financial help without fostering independence. This kind of help often does more harm than good, creating cycles of dependency and resentment. True empowerment comes when you teach others (or learn yourself) to create sustainable value independently.

I recount personal anecdotes in this segment, like my initial struggles with setting a Thrive budget, which gradually led me to adjust my expectations and goals as I better understood my needs and the potential of my business. It took me — earning $4,000 a month with a target of $6,000 initially — some time to realize that $8,000 was a more realistic thrive number for the type of life and business I wanted. These realizations are not just about numbers; they are about understanding what these numbers can facilitate in your life—the freedom, the growth, and the stability.

In this journey, we must face the realities of our financial responsibilities and our emotional connections to money and value. How you think about money influences what you manifest in your life. If your mindset is shackled by negativity, feelings of insufficiency, or fear of failure, these will reflect in your financial outcomes. Breaking these cycles requires intentional action, clarity of purpose, persistence, and sometimes hard lessons learned through experience.

One significant part of the narrative is the discussion on how I approached teaching and pricing my workshops. These weren’t just opportunities to earn but platforms for empowerment—both for myself and for those attending. When I set my goal to make my workshops lucrative, it wasn’t out of greed—it was about recognizing my value and the quality of what I had to offer. Hitting a $500,000 goal in a workshop that initially aimed at $100,000 wasn't just a financial achievement; it was a testament to the value and transformation those workshops promised and delivered.

Furthermore, personal stories from my engagement with online platforms and creating scalable content bring out lessons on value creation and personal branding. I discuss navigating negative feedback, recognizing its roots in other’s perceptions and fears, and more importantly, how such feedback should guide not deter your paths.

In essence, this segment revolves around understanding the intrinsic link between your emotional self and your financial actions. It’s about marrying your passions with practicality, asserting your worth confidently through the financial targets you set and meet, and continuously striving for alignment between your personal values, your brand’s ethos, and your business’s financial objectives.

Through my narrative, I aim to empower listeners to take a deep dive into their financial and emotional fears, confront them, and use these learnings to fuel a cycle of positive manifestation. What’s crucial here is the shift from passive dreaming to active, intentional doing. This segment not only provides insights into the mechanics of building a successful brand that reflects one’s values and worth but also underscores a deep, introspective look into personal growth and empowerment through financial understanding and independence.
