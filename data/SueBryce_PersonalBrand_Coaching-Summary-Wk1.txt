Coaching Wk 1 - Money

Welcome to the first week of our Personal Brand Coaching, focusing on Money. As an experienced speaker and educator, I've mastered the art of teaching not just what I do but how I do it, which has significantly transformed my ability to reach and impact audiences. Today is about moving our needles, shifting our focus from the mere struggle with money to embracing and managing abundance effectively.

I urge everyone to make a declaration. Today is the day you will no longer struggle with money. Write it down, believe it, and start acting on it. We are going to open doors to monetary flow and ensure that money not only comes but stays and grows within your reach.

The key to this transformation is not just seeing the possibilities but also structuring your approach towards money management. People buy organized content and structured guidance—that's where true value lies. Organize your content and approach in such a way that what you offer is clear, necessary steps towards a solution.

Talking about the next steps, let's delve into the importance of creating timelines in business. A timeline isn't just about when things will happen but is more about the path and actions needed towards achieving financial goals. Connect your goals with specific actions; this is what makes a timeline effective.

Linking business to personal development, I often compare financial planning to dieting. Many struggle and fail because they aren't connected to their real goals; they don't address core issues but only chase superficial outcomes.

This coaching session is more than just words; it's about real action and change. It involves looking into yourselves, recognizing money lies, and commitments to change these narratives. Understanding where you are financially—not just in your personal life but in your business—is crucial. Are your businesses really thriving, or are they merely surviving?

Let's talk about real action steps—mapping out your financial activities. Identify where you are and where you want to be. From survival to management to accumulation, each step must be clear and actionable. If your business isn't making money, acknowledge it, accept it, and plan to change it.

Creating an effective financial plan means understanding your expenses and income thoroughly. Know your numbers. How much do you need to survive? What’s your Thrive number? These numbers dictate the immediate actions needed—cutting unnecessary expenses, focusing on essential costs, and planning for future growth.

Building an emergency fund, redirecting surplus towards profitable ventures, and investing wisely are steps toward financial liberation. Setting a $100,000 emergency fund isn’t just a number; it's a buffer against future uncertainties, providing peace of mind and financial security.

Finally, integrating your financial goals with daily rituals is crucial for sustained success. Whether it's affirmations, setting reminders, or simple visualization exercises, these daily practices help reinforce your financial paths and goals. Remember, money growth requires consistency and dedication. Engage with your financial goals daily and watch your path illuminate with progress and achievements.

Join me in this transformative journey. Change your money narrative. And remember, every change begins with a clear intention and committed action. Let’s move our needles together and embrace financial abundance and personal brand growth. I’m ready to change your world today—are you?
