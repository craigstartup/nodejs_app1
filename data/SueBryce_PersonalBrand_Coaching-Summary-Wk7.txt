Coaching Wk 7 - Marketing

In this week's personal brand coaching, I explored an expanded approach to marketing, a realm that has dramatically evolved for me, especially after transitioning from teaching photography to focusing solely on broader business content and self-development. This shift necessitated a rethink of my marketing strategies, which I've been rigorously testing to see what resonates with my audience. Today, I'll share these insights, hoping it helps clarify your own marketing approaches.

Initially, my journey into teaching photographers was straightforward because it mirrored my personal experience. However, selling a sold photography platform and venturing back with new business content did not transpose as smoothly as one might expect. The difference in fields illustrated that brilliance in one area does not inherently translate to another without reevaluating and altering your marketing strategy.

One significant insight was the understanding of Instagram’s evolving platform. What once worked wonderfully no longer holds the same power unless adapted to current trends. For instance, Instagram now values video content more, pushing many to adapt or fade into obscurity. Additionally, platforms like Pinterest have resurged, particularly for visually-oriented professions, proving that staying adaptive is crucial.

Throughout these revelations, finding one’s voice in the cacophony of digital content became a focal point of discussion. It's about discovering that balance between sharing knowledgeable content and not sounding salesy, which can be a delicate dance. Initially, I felt inhibited, fearing the judgment that might come with posting content. But overcoming that with confidence is key to delivering genuine value, which ultimately defines successful marketing.

Moreover, the discussion veered towards effective communication on social media. The essence lies in not just posting but engaging meaningfully—whether through blogging, vlogging, or creating impactful reels. Each of these mediums has its strengths, but they must all lead back to authentic communication that resonates with the audience on a human level.

An extensive part of the session was dedicated to refining clarity in one's marketing message. It’s vital to have a 3x3 clarity about who you are, what you do, and who you do it for, along with precise knowledge of your industry and content pillars. This knowledge should be reflected across all social media platforms consistently to maintain a cohesive personal brand.

Finally, we discussed the strategic placement of content, especially understanding when and how to sell. Sales shouldn’t always be direct but embedded within valuable content that endears the audience first to the brand’s ethos. For instance, leveraging a personal story or an educational tip within marketing can lead to deeper engagement, which in due course can facilitate sales more organically.

The essence of today’s lesson was to encourage thinking beyond traditional marketing narratives. It’s about tapping into the core of one's personal brand to communicate, connect, and convert in a manner that feels both natural to oneself and engaging to the audience. Keeping up with evolving platforms and integrating direct feedback from these interactions continues to be the cornerstone of my growth and understanding in this highly dynamic field. Whether adjusting to the whims of social media algorithms or finding new ways to convey value, the adaptability in your marketing strategy can make or break the impact you wish to achieve. 

By next week, I look forward to wrapping up these series with an interactive session that should help cement these concepts further, gearing everyone up to take their branding efforts to the next level efficiently and authentically.
