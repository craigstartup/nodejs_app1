“No me habia ejercitado desde que nació mi bebé hace año y medio y ninguna app de Jericho que he probado me ha gustado desde el primer entrenamiento como esta. Es hermoso como utilizas todo el cuerpo para generar movimiento más funcional. Simplemente me encanta además de que reta mi condición física 100%, justo lo que estaba buscando”
— Yuridia J.

“I love this workout @ 65yr balance combined with strength is so important and it is great having the balance test at the start and end of the session to measure progress, I will be doing this one regularly.”
— Sandra G.
“That felt amazing. I often want to push hard with weights when what I really need is mobility. I appreciate this combo”
— Missy H.
“LOVE THIS CLASS! I love making the most of my time and working both strength and mobility into my routine. A perfect routine for when I want to make the most of the time I have!”
— Victoria P.
“I enjoyed it!!!”
— Maria H.
“I really appreciated the integration of mobility and strength! Increasing weight amounts, and reps depending on one's workout goals, whilst taking form into consideration, will make for a more challenging workout. More workout like this would be great.”
— Nakazzi K.
“Simple and concise body weight to weighted movements.”
— Catherine G.
“Loved this! I need to work on both mobility and strength so love the combination, more please!”
— Sandi G.
“These are really nice programmes, even for those who have back hernias and/or are not that fit. There is a huge variety of sessions, so you never get bored. The exercises, which are of exceptional quality, are well explained. The challenge is to choose amongst the huge offer of sessions and your discipline to do the exercises on a regular basis. All in all I highly recommend Kaisafit (I am a member since 2021 and am still a happy customer by 2024)”
— Dorothea S.
“I love the variety, especially the mobility and strength training videos. I’ve done so many different videos from other brands in the past, but Just Move is by far my favorite and I’m never going back.”
— Jessica H.
“It's great! I love your workouts. I think the only thing that would be helpful is to have like a personal library where we can find videos we have saved. Thank you for your work :)”
— Amanda V.
“I love Kaisa's vibe! So motivating but gentle”
— Elena N.
“I am so grateful for this resource that you have created. I started following Kaisa on instagram during the beginning of COVID in 2020. I was looking for a way to be excited about moving my body. The price point for this online collection simply can't be beat. I come back time and again. I loved when Georgina Shaffer was added, as I think plus sized coaches are so crucial to make people feel seen, valued, and celebrated, and she was already a favorite of mine from her work at Joyn. I really enjoy the videos from Rachel Goodner, Kisha Vaughan, Anish Arora, and of course Kaisa. I think over time you have gotten much better at pacing beginner workouts. My one ask would be to include a bit more cool down time in videos. Thank you!”
— Holly H.
“I love it! ❤️ Looking forward to doing this every mornings.”
— Brigitte F.
“I absolutely love the energy that Kasia brings. I am excited to also have diverse workout options for what my body is in the mood for. I am here for the positive messaging around health as not an esthetic but a feel we embody. I have used other platforms that use messaging toward getting rid of or slimming rather than adding to ourselves. If you are looking to shed that perspective as well as have fun while making this part of your routine then you are in the right place!”
— Lexi M.
“I love these movement videos and workouts...SO MUCH!! They are fun and make my body feel alive. Kaisa is so encouraging and positive; it's the best way to start the morning. Leaves me feeling great for the rest for the rest of the day.”
— Elizabeth B.
“I love these movement videos and workouts...SO MUCH!!”
— Elizabeth B.
“Beat the Clock workout is great! I like that the format allows me to go at my own pace and ability level if I can’t keep up with Kaisa. With just four, fairly simply moves, it’s also very beginner friendly. Would love to see this as it’s own series with different exercises/emphasis areas, or even better, a 30 day challenge with multiple “Beat the Clock” workouts.”

“Fantastic, creative, and fun! Kaisa is a master of her craft. She knows how the body works and how it moves. Her workouts never fail to get my heart rate up and the sweat flowing but are so adaptable and accessible. People of all shapes, sizes, and ability will find something here because Kansa’s program explores various ranges of motion while taking great care to offer modification and reminders to listen to one’s body. In this way, and in others, Kiasa’s offerings are inclusive and challenging! Her programs over the last several years have helped me greatly throughout many stages of fitness on my life long health and wellness journey. Thank you Kaisa!!”

“Omg! Breathing so hard on a full body 20min workout!! Love it!”
— Denys L.
“Worth every penny. I'm an older mom of young kids, and keeping my brain and body fit for them is a high priority for me. Just Move is a really easy way to do that daily, whether I have an hour on a Saturday or 20 minutes before work during the week. I love the variety- there are tough tabata workouts and mellow yoga/mobility flows. Kaisa's energy and enthusiasm powers me through difficult moves, and her kind approach and expertise in training people of all fitness levels is obvious. I really love this program.”

“That was amazing. Why has it taken me this long to find this?! I’m a nurses so I work 12 hr shifts. I also have a 3.5 year old son. Never been active, have poor posture, practice poor body mechanics at work, live a sedentary lifestyle if left to my own devices. BUT, I’m in my 30s and have an physically active job. I have a Peloton and done Couch to 5K 2-3x. Same thing happens everytime. I get really into it and start exercising moderately, but I either injure myself or need a rest day after work and in between whatever virus my son brings home. Having just completed 1 workout, my body doesn’t hurt and I could see myself doing more and more in a stepwise fashion that increases my mobility outside of work, but won’t cause injuries. Woohoo!”

“Love it. Kaisa killed me in 10 min 😊”
— Alexandra V.
“I love these start videos. I used to always say I wish there were beginner workout videos for those who have never begun, because too often the videos would assume some level of fitness or flexibility. It really made it difficult for me to lose weight because I would get frustrated as I couldn't do like half the work outs or would get winded too quickly. These videos have helped me start to workout and I am now starting to build a routine.”
— Hannah M.

“After being laid up for months with chronic debilitating sciatica, and a subsequent Fybromalgia diagnosis, I had been struggling with pain, fear of movement and worries that I would never feel any better. I found Kaisafit and gave it a try, starting with the START programmes, even finding those incredibly challenging in the beginning. A year of persisting with those, worrying I would never be able to progress from there, I stuck with it. Now I am on my third round of the 30 day beginners programme and I can't believe the difference! I feel stronger, more mobile, in less pain and I look forward to the workouts each and every day. I have only missed 5 days in the last 2 months and to say this has changed my life is an understatement. I love the variety of workouts, encouragement from all the instructors and in particularly find Kaisa to be amazing in her upbeat, kind, encouraging nature. I know that I can stick with it. Who knows, someday I might even progress to the intermediate workouts. It does not feel like an impossible goal! I can't thank you enough.”

— Kelli C.
“I am only about a week in to my membership with Just Move/KaisaFit, and I’m a huge fan. I am a 40 year old mom of two young girls, and my focus has shifted from strength and aesthetics to mobility, agility, flexibility, and strength. The accessibility and number of programs seems to hit all my requirements to maintain and improve my goals as mentioned above, and I can include my girls in working out with her kids classes. The price can not be beat either. I am actually blown away at $20/month for all of these programs.”

It would be great to get a little more direction on where I am in regards to flexibility and strength so that I could be recommended videos that are in line with my ability. Doing a lot of trial and error for now and most of the coaches are awesome :). (would give 4.5 stars if possible).”

“I was in a car accident five months ago, where my SI joint was damaged. Although I have recovered a lot, I am still left with chronic SI joint pain. The sports medicine doctor told me that I now just have to live with chronic back pain as if that didn’t mean anything. I have been doing my physio, mobility and stretching which all brought me mild relief… but with the SI joint relief yoga video led by Elaina, I have been able to get a good nights sleep every time I do it before bed and I am so grateful!”

— Jodi V.
“I have been consistently doing workouts on Just Move for the last 3 months. I recently signed up for the “spring training” program with a little bit of concern, as in the past 40 some years, “athletic” is not a word that’s ever been used to describe me. But I finished the “cardio for champions” with Luka today with a huge smile on my face. I loved his explanations of the why behind the moves. I’ll never be in the Olympics, but I sure as heck felt like an athlete in my living room. Just Move has been the most consistent I’ve been with activity in a long while, in part because there’s so much great variety so I don’t ever feel bored, and also because the coaches seem like great people, and not once has there been any focus on “weight loss” as a goal- just a focus on having fun moving. Genuinely happy with how much stronger and healthier I feel, and a tiny bit shocked that I’m having fun exercising….”
— Meghan D.

“I’m pretty out of shape and admit I do a lot of starting and stopping of planned movement. I would often be disheartened by “beginner” workouts that were too difficult for me to do. I saw an add for KaisaFit a year or so ago and was so excited by Kaisa as a teacher and while it’s clear she can lead super intense advanced workouts, she’s also WONDERFUL at leading doable workouts for absolute beginners, people who are really out of shape or have some limitations. She’s also wonderfully down to earth and so encouraging! One thing I’ll say: So. Many. Planks. However, she teaches you how to do them on a chair in the Start programs, so I’m actually able to build myself up and get stronger doing them so that I CAN do them on the floor. I’ll admit I’ve been really up and down with my consistency lately and have “started over” a few times, but I also know that the Start programs will definitely help me rebuild my strength. It’s also why even though I purchased the downloadable workouts, I also have a subscription to Just Move because they’re always adding new videos, including Start videos! So much variety, even for my level. One other thing. I’ve only tried a few workouts from other instructors (Kisha from Start Dance and Elena from Start Yoga) and they’re wonderful, too! All of them make me smile and look forward to my next workout with them!”
— Rosalind L.

“Thks”
— Christine F.
“This was a good stretch. However, I'm a bigger girl, and would like to see some yoga videos that take that into account. It would be especially helpful, as a beginner, so have some alternative adjustments for positions that I just simply can't do or hold for any significant amount of time.”
— Brittany W.
“Kaisa is contagious! I love her energy throughout! She is sincere and an absolute FORCE!”
— Judi G.
“Fantastic way to start the day! Sweaty and worked in 30 min!”
— Megan B.
“Great mix of mobility and pure strength! Kaisa keeps it super positive and fun, excellent cuing.”
— Lorraine P.
“Perfect beginning!”
— Ros G.

“I love Just Move workouts! Kaisa and the team are amazing instructors and I love that they don’t use any diety verbiage on earning food or intentional weight loss. I’ve learned so much about my body through these workouts and what is normal when doing a new move, which I used to think there was something wrong with me or my move with past instructors. Love love love all the community in Just Move!”
— Araceli R.
“Great easy to follow instructions. Love that the video is not very long for those moments when we’re pressed for time.”
— Senorina G.

“Great”
— ELizabeth G.
“I have been working out for over 30 years, but for the first time in my workout life I actually feel good doing it. The Just Move trainers are amazing and inclusive. And finally, some even look like me- meaning curvy bodies. Not every female has that super lean dancer body; yet they all look healthy and in shape. I feel good while working out and good about myself. The positive messages and views of the trainers are uplifting instead of hurtful. This is the right place to be to workout and feel good.”
— Airrion S.
“Great initial session. I am just getting back in working out and this was the perfect combo. Thanks!! 💪 on the MOVE”
— Ana M O.
“Wow - I keep coming back to this class. Luv the energy; mix of movement and the fabulous stretch at the end. For someone who does NOT like cardio I truly enjoy this movement. Instruction is clear and I love the energy it brings. But more importantly we get a truly good stretch at the end. NOT all the classes offer such a thorough stretch. So well done. Def 5 star workout for a beginner who is trying to introduce cardio (dr approved) post injury.”
— Edith D.
“first time on this program and i did a yoga spine strengthened with elaina chung- so clear and encouraging and the metaphors helped me understand stretches. i’m excited to keep this routine up.”
— Kim V.

— Susi K.
“Sooo good !! Loved every sec of it”
— Samantha P.
“Love that I can always find something to fit my mood or my time constraints. The feature of being able to add videos to "my favorites " is so wonderful-- I can return to videos I especially liked, and very easily! Being able to join programs at my pace is such a joy. It's choose your own adventure, but for movement!!”
— Mara B.

“The exercises are great! I wish you would go a little slower though. :)”
— Tatjana G.
“Hello! I really do enjoy the Just Move app. It is changing my perspective of movement and the quality of my life. However, some nice-to-haves would be that whenever I am looking for workouts, it automatically searches for the ones that match my level such as Beginner. Also, I would love to have more dance workouts that have choreographies and music similar to Steezy. Lastly, more boxing classes would be appreciated as well.”
— Elvia B.
“Intense”
— Deborah P.
“Thank You Kaisa! Short and tough.”
— Bekah R.

— Brenda V.
“Gentle warmup movements; should also make a nice desk break during the work day.”
— D W.
“My first video was Georgina’s gentle opening. I am so happy that there was a place I could start. I know it is just step #1 in a countless number of steps to move more, but Georgina’s simple chair routine made me look forward to step #2. Thank you, Georgina.”
— Emily K.

“Fantastic”
— April G.
“I love this membership. I wish I had gotten it sooner. I feel like I’m in the room working out with Kaisa.

“I LOVE Just Move! I have carpel tunnel in both my wrist and a heart condition I was really Really struggling last year after my 4th heart operation to get back into training never before have I had trouble my body was sore and heart would beat funny I had to take it slow I never took training slow or did short work outs I liked to train hard and fast now it was different. I follow Kisa on Insta and through I would give her just move membership a go try the start challenge out seeing as I was still struggling to train how I normally would. I completed the start workout challenge a few times as I was recovering but i was moving and it felt good to do something then I went on to the Mini challenges and Love it all of them and it helped me get back into training and I am now addicted to Just Move their is always something new and different to try. for the first time ever I am seeing results. I am toning up. I love the mini challenges my favs as with everyone a busy life so not much time. Thank you so Much Kisa for creating Just Move and helping me know I am more then my body and understanding it to move in what ever feels best for my body each day on any level and any stage I am at.”

— Jewell J.

“Just joined, was a KaisaFit fit member for a number of years. 2020 things changed. Started with a misdiagnosed sprained ankle that was broken. So in a brace then a boot for a longtime. Lots of limping lead to hip issues. Then fractured my knee 2 places and torn lateral meniscus. (Hit by a dog in flyball) all of which ended in a total hip Replacment in July. Sooo super outta shape but cleared for everything!! Day 2 really drove home how much I need this. I preach now how to NEVER EVER take your mobility for granted. I just want my strength back ❤️”

“I love Kaisa, her team and all the workouts on this website. The moments are not over the top and there is no pretense in the video instruction. I can choose my level of difficulty!!”
— Brandy B.
“Kaisa, you are my go-to every time I'm deployed, and I promise if it weren't for you and your team's programs, I would be in a world of hurt and a head full of frustration. Thank you for sharing with us your world of movement! A healthy body makes for a happy Sailor!”
— Shonda S.
“I haven’t worked out in years and have so much shame about that, and the reminder that even 5 minutes is something to be celebrated felt so encouraging. I’m so glad I started this program!”
— Katherine S.
“The library is so extensive and it covers such a wide range of workout options that i can pick and choose according to the time I have available the mood I'm in at the moment. Trainers give out clear and precise instructions and they're easy to follow. Needless to say, I love Just Move, I can workout even when I'm traveling.”
— Grace N.

“This was a great work out! I loved it! And Rachel is AMAZING! She makes me feel like were actually taking a class together! She's one of my favorite coaches!!! Thank you Rachel Goodner & thank you Just Move!!”

— Jennifer V.
“Amazing class! Exactly what I needed. As a yoga instructor, it’s a treat to take in a practice ♥️”
— Janine B.
“I use this warmup All. The. Time. and I've never used it for a walk, haha. It's the perfect gentle movement to ease into the day, so I often use it first thing in the morning or before a more intense exercise class. Currently, I'm rehabbing from a knee injury, and this is perfect as a warmup for PT because the lateral movement is very controlled and there's basically no chance for me to slip or lose balance, and it also hits all the stabilizing joints and muscles that can get so cranky when you have an imbalance due to injury (or whatever cause). tl;dr = big fan!”
— J S.
“Oh my stars!!! I had so much fun doing the strength challenge this month. I saw lots of improvement as we progress through the program. Getting jazzed for the yoga challenge now. Thank you so much for the work you and your team of coaches put into these workouts. My mind and body appreciate it so very much. xoxo, Cynthia States”
— Cynthia S.
“Love love love- just what I need”
— Laurie E.
“I joined Just Move for the 4-week Get Strong challenge and never thought one could show much improvement in strength and mobility from training at home with limited equipment. Kaisa is an amazing coach. She kept me consistent over the 4 weeks and her training style made me want to return to the mat for each session. Join Just Move, you won't regret it!”
— Veda N.
“Thank you Georgina , It’s nice to see Full figured women such as myself on these videos thanks again just keep moving team.”
— Diana N.
“Good”
— Nikki J.

— Deagon W.
“It has very well planned programs and great motivate coaches.”
— Cruz G.
“Fantastic method to be fit for those who want to fit many activities into their busy life. Sheduled challanges - my favourite - I cannot miss a deadline if I signed up where with regular trainings I may find an excuse to skip and "promise" to do it tomorrow:) I love different level, various movements, not repetitive routine. Thank you, Kaisa!”
— Svetlana B.
“hi there - not a review, more of a feedback. for people with lower back problems (like myself, disc herniation a couple of years ago, some on and off arthrosis in the lower parts of the spine), i recommend to approach this workout with caution and lighter weights, as all the moves together may reactivate pain and or induce a high muscular tension (eg glutes). especially the "challenge" at the end may tempt you to push too far. otherwise i love the challenge, as dumbells are my favorite and kaisa's gift to motivate is a great help!”
— Mueller B.
“Workouts are well-composed, instruction is clear and, unlike many workout programs I have seen, there is no emphasis on punishing yourself or "making up for" something I ate. With that said, as someone who is just getting back into exercise, the difficulty was really high for me and I was sore for about 5 days!”
— Lacey W.
“Soreness like I’ve never experienced. Uncomplicated and approachable movements. Feels amazing and can’t wait for the upcoming weeks - let’s GOOOOO!!!”
— Priya M.

“So nice for my back!”
— Katie C.

“Quick! And…. Effective!! Sweating buckets and feeling every step I take. I love going back to the basics for lower body day.”
— Jordan N.
“Love it!!!!”
— Peggy J.
“Love the energy and positivity of the 2 videos I've done so far. I would love to be able to play videos through my Roku, like I have done with a different fitness program. They had a Roku app that didn't do anything except communicate with their app on my phone to play videos on my TV. That capability would make this a 5 star program for me!”
— Kelly L.
“She goes just a little bit too fast. I was always like 3 reps behind her.”
— Natalia C.
“So good love the focus on form”
— Anna J.
“I usually do cardio on my elliptical but I was ready to start strength training. This was a perfect workout and a great trainer. See you tomorrow.”
— Sara M.

“Such a great kick start for me back into self healing and active mode. As a former track and field athlete I appreciate the types of movements that I remember from working out with the team in the gym. Thank you!”
— Aqueelah T.
“I just read that my morning workout isn’t enough to counteract the negative physical effects of my sedentary desk job. I’m trying to be more purposeful about getting more movement throughout my work day, and these little 5 minute videos are perfect for waking up my muscles and joints!”
— Julie M.
“Great first day and motivation to continue w the program. Kaisa walks you through the whole way and it isn’t all easy either. It’s a great start, a great sweat and I feel awesome 🤙🏼❤️”

— Constanza L.
“so fantastic. i love kaisa, and all the instructors really. workouts are logical, safe, challenging and fun. i trust them”
— Russell S.
“I was burned by a very “rules based”, extreme-thinking exercise program about four years ago. I’ve been looking for a body-friendly workout where I was encouraged to love my body through movement, not for vanity. I am thrilled to have found Kaisa! She’s the answer to all of my complaints for most other programs. I purchased her Mobility Strength workout about 18 months ago (and love it) and recently purchased Just Move. Sooooo happy!! Kaisa, what you do in modeling for us how to love ourselves through movement is beautiful, and it is healing me.”
— Sarah Y.

“Tough for my first workout. Left me felling 🤢”
— Jen C.
“This is the program when you’ve tried to get back into shape only to injure yourself over and over and started to feel like you just can’t workout. Start Moving! It feels so good!”
— Jennifer G.
“Ashley is awesome!!”
— Gwen J.

“Such a fun workout!”
— Kelley R.
“Thank you! Needed to start again, this is it😊”
— Romano T.
“Good reminder of what I can can do for my tight hips during my day. I sit for much of my day. I have trouble with hip pain and stability and strength . thank you Kaisa and team”
— Jennifer R.
“Wow, this platform is my absolute favorite way to get my body moving. There are so many class options that no matter my mood or energy level/needs there is always something that fits just right. I also really appreciate all the focus on what feels good for your body, the value of movement, and nothing about weight loss, etc. This is helping me on my journey of healing my relationship with movement. (The only thing that would make this better is for an app or some ability to download videos for times when I don’t have access to Wi-Fi!)”
— Rachael P.
“This one's "choice"....as we say down-under. Quick & sweaty.”
— Carol A.
“I enjoy the Yoga flows so much! The entire Just Move subscription is excellent - especially love it when traveling, I can still find time to get some movement in!”
— Heather R.
“Love the range of fitness videos on your website. I have done different ones so far and love each one. It has motivated me to stay on track and I look forward to my exercise time every morning! Thank you!”

— AMY V.
“Love this workout and encouragement!”
— Winona H.
“I've been using the Just Move library for just over a year. I love the variety of classes offered, along with the many capable and dynamic instructors. I've recommended Just Move to so many friends of all backgrounds. There's really something for everyone!”
— Amy L.
“I discovered Kaisa on Facebook during the pandemic lockdown. I loved the mobility approached and felt like I could do what she was demonstrating even though I had quit teaching spinning at the start of the lockdown and had not done any kind of serious exercise in three months. During a scorpion stretch, I felt like I had a grain of rice in my sports bra. Turns out, I had a tiny tumor. I went through a double-mastectomy with reconstruction, chemotherapy, oopherectomy, and am now on hormone blockers. I like to think that Kaisa's mobility workouts saved my life. I got the JustMove membership after I finished treatment because I knew that I could do the work. I hate weight training, but Mobility work, and the combination of body weight and mobility helps me stay strong and fit.”
— Stefanie L.

“Excelente ejercicio!”
— Alma C.
“Loved this workout by Phillip Berry. The sweat was real! Fastpaced and challenging, just what I needed today! Will definitely come back to this one and see how I progress over the next months. Thanks, Phillip!”
— Denise T.
“Just move has everything you might need and for any amount of time you have! Body weight workouts, strength workouts, mobility, and yoga. I would highly recommend this to everyone. The coaches make you feel like they're right there with you and that you can push through and achieve whatever goals you have. I only have great things to say. Just join now!”
— Deedra F.
“This is how you do a BEGINNER workout!”
— Kristen P.

“My favorite, and what drew me to Just Move, is the mobility series. I’ve struggled with hip and lower back pain for years. I’ve come to rely on these as a supplement to the strength/endurance classes I take, first with in-person Orangetheory classes and currently with the at-home Peloton classes. I like that I can do these on my own schedule and anywhere I have access to my iPad/Wi-Fi. The short 5-15 minute videos are the best tension/stress relievers when I’m in between Zoom or Teams meetings and also a great way to start/end the day. If you’re like me and struggle to make workout buddies, just know that you have a great coach and role model in Kaisa.”
— Kimi A.
“My first ever Just Move video with Kaisa (Start Cardio) has me feeling limber, energized, and ready to come back for more! Kaisa gives us just enough of a push while also making sure we listen to our bodies and stay safe.”
— Erica F.
“Excelente!! Lo mejor que pude haber hecho para mi vida!!!”
— Gonzalo C.
“Great sequence and pacing.”
— Kemi U.

“I really enjoy dancing and have looked for something exactly like this online before. I enjoy this so much. It is very well paced and on days when I am struggling with a new part, it is very comforting that I can go back and replay sections as much as I need. Kisha’s personality is very welcoming, encouraging, and fun. After a year recovering from foot surgery, I am so excited to rebuild my health and my dancing abilities.”
— Kayla W.
“I love Kaisa and her workouts! She has a healthy, real body and a kind personality. Her exercises are gentle enough for beginners (in the Start series) but they are very effective. Many of her movements are so different some anything I've ever seen before in a workout video. But her little tweaks and adjustments take them even a 5 min stretching session to the next level. Thank you, Kaisa!”
— Juhi K.
“Loved this new mobility flow. It’s exactly what I needed!!!”
— Josee L.

“Loved it! Very challenging 🔥🔥😅”
— Julianne R.

“GREAT! Loved it!”
— Roxanne B.
“I am so happy I have re-subscribed. This accessible format with a focus on mobility and injury prevention is great for someone like myself who is recovering from a back injury. Kaisa and all of the instructions are able to provide the cuing necessary to ensure safe and effective exercise. Kaisa's positive wellness-based approach is refreshing. What truly keeps me coming back is the fact that I can get the movement/exercise I need without the toxicity of diet culture. I am so grateful for that.”
— Camille C.
“I would love to see 60 minutes workouts. Also this could be a bit more challenging without adding cardio.”
— Marsha G.

“Amazing! I’m a very active person and I love being able to learn from likeminded people. I just finished a recovery flow and my body feels so much better than when I started. Looking forward to diving deeper into all the different classes.”
— Valerie L.
“This was a total pick me up after a frustrating day. Perfect reset and now I’m ready to jump back in! Thanks a MILLION!”
— Jen B.
“Absolutely love this workout!”
— Florence S.
“I am so incredibly grateful to have found Kaisa and these workouts. I'm getting back into movement, and Kaisa is so motivating and the moves don't feel overwhelming. I'm feeling strong and find myself looking forward to the next workout!”
— Paige J.
“Excellent beginner yoga that left me feeling centered and elongated. Thank you!”
— Katherine S.
“My daughter had so much fun doing this! And as always Kaisa is the best!!”
— Kristyn R.
“It will be great if you could offer an app to have access to the workouts and programs from the phone. Also, I hope you could offer an easier way to access favorite workouts and see them all of them at once as currently you can only see them in a horizontal format and not all of them together. I have enjoyed the workouts that I have done with Kaisa but I would like to see more of the advanced, combo movements she performs in her ad videos on FB with other equipment like boxes, ropes, barbells, balls, etc. I hope you can offer more intense workouts with challenging compounded movements. Thank you!”
— Iduma O.
“I love the variation of workouts available, particularly the variety of levels and lengths of classes! Every instructor has a different way of teaching and their unique approach to the body, which I love... and the more I explore, the more refined I can make my selection match my interests and needs for the day. I will say that I am so relieved that there are also yoga classes on the program. As a yoga teacher, I value the strength building and HIIT style classes, but my body really desires a mindful, strong yoga practice- and the yoga classes are just perfect! Elena in particular just has such an informed set of cues that (even as a yoga teacher) leaves me with a ton of "a-ha!" moments... and the cadence is just right! It's a perfect complement to the fast paced classes. Overall so grateful for Just Move! Kaisa is supreme and has a sharp eye for cherry picking the best of the best instructors.”
— Sonja S.
“This was a REALLY good class but some people (including me) don't really sweat even when working very hard. So the only "peeve" was the reference by the instructor saying stuff like "I'm sweating up a storm, you must be too..." I would most likely do this class again because I got such a good workout but might be likely to put on some background music.”
— Lisa C.
“I love this lady, she makes me feel stronger. Love her motivation and truth.”
— Andrea B.
“First exercise session back after being slack for 3 months, thought I could do it on my own but super glad I signed up. Feeling great and excited to do more sessions!”
— Rachel M.
“This was super fun! I was definitely sweating!!!”
— Karen M.
“Nice”
— Sami R.
“Kaisa, I now love my body, and she is my best friend! I have been doing Just Move everyday since January. I’ve lost close to 20 pounds and 2+ inches off my measurements, but better than that, I feel great! I move my body every day. The challenges are fun and keep me going, and I don’t have to plan a workout, just follow along. My body and I THANK YOU!”
— Susan G.

— Tammy R.
“Hi, I am finding the choice a bit overwhelming. I was told by my physio to do a routine that will strengthen hip, glutes, leg and mobility. I am just starting to exercise again. What routine/challenge would you recommend? Thanks you for your guidance”
— Cristina C.
“Just finished day 1 and when I heard the words “that’s all” I cried. I was fully prepared to encounter movements I wouldn’t be able to follow. Instead the instructor was so mindful and self informed. I’m excited for tomorrow. This is the first time I’ve ever been excited for tomorrow’s exercise!”
— Rachel L.
“Okay, where do I begin? I’m a 25 year PE and Dance teacher feeling all of the aches of my professional career and age, however, working out is my happy place. I’ve tried several apps, videos, classes looking for the right kind of challenge for me, and guess what? I’ve found it. As a former competitor, I like the challenge of weighted work, super sets, agility and coordination work. Kaisa has created those workouts that meet my demands. I’m a little less achy and gaining back mobility in my shoulders, hips and back. I’m in my happy sweaty place, thank you!”
— Adelina B.
“Kaisa you are the awesomest instructor in the world 😍 Your workouts are incredibly fun, I don't feel like suffering during the exercises and still I'm just magically getting back to shape and beyond that. Thank you so much!”
— Emmi K.
“This programming offers an unprecedented range of options for any athlete, any person, at any stage of their lives. I've used their yoga, strength, mobility, and dance classes, and each instructor is helpful, smart, and engaging. Can't recommend enough!”
— Katie R.
“I am not a religious person but... HALLELUJA!! I work in the health/rehab industry so I know how to exercise and write programs but after a huge length of time off exercising I have been struggling to get back to it. I have tried my own stuff as well as multiple online 'beginner' programs but mentally I can't do them because my mind just says 'no, these are too hard right now'. I can (very) happily say I have fully completed all the Just Move sessions I have tried so far. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!”
— Yvette G.
“Great class but could you change the warm up every so often as always the same!”
— Anna B.

— Karin T.
“This was my first Kisha workout and I loved her energy! So appreciated that there is a 10 minute option for a totally newbie! Thank you :)”

— evonn P.
“And so iT begins !”
— Betti N.
“Loved this workout! I didn’t have any dumbbells and still found it challenging.”
— Divine C.
“Just did the Day 1 of the Start program. I have done structured movement before in my life (I was a theater person and did warm ups), but I have medicine-related weight gain, and I have NOT moved since I was at least 10 years younger and 50 pounds lighter, so I have been quite concerned about moving again, because my body is very different. But I don't have a schedule which allows me to go to most in-person exercise classes. Day 1 of Just Move START was perfect. She encouraged listening to your body, and I can tell already that I will be able to go at my own pace, figure out what is good for my body, and repeat as many times as I want to ensure I'm comfortable before moving forward. I'm no longer afraid of starting to move on my own at home!”
— Angela R.
“I love Just Move! I’ve been following Kaisa for about 4 years now, but Just Move has introduced me to new trainers, new exercises, and new challenges! It is super user friendly, with variations for all levels, it got me through losing weight for my wedding, staying strong during my pregnancy, and now bouncing back in my postpartum!”
— Sarah G.
“Great low impact cardio for those of us with janky knees. I was able to slow down when necessary, but my heart rate stayed up. Didn't feel like I was cheating.”
— Tenetta C.
“Great 20min !!!”
— Veronica D.
“I am on day 3 of the 30 DAY CHALLENGE for beginners. I have been recovering for the past year from an injury. Prior to the injury, I would have considered myself as an advanced/intermediate. I feel like I am back to square one - working on my balance. Thank you for 2 insights: One - my body is my friend and I DO NOT beat up my friend. I am being much more kind to myself during my recovery and Two - it's ok to start slow and work at MY pace, not anyone else's. In addition to your work outs, I am walking ALOT! (my dog is very happy). Thank you Kaisa, I love your videos, podcast and your laugh. Take care and lots of blessings to you.”
— Robin F.
“This was awesome! thank you <3 I have years of experience in kickboxing and Shidokan karate, recovering from a hamstring tear - this was perfect to ease back into the upper body moves. Thank you so very much for building this workout. I love your passion and positive, empowering energy! So motivating and fun!”
— Amy L.
“Good cardio workout. I like the different drills Kaisa incorporates. Definitely got my heart rate up and I broke a sweat. Burned 160 calories in 32 minutes and this is only using body weight. I always find switch lunges a little tricky, but it’s ok, I replace them with other things. Thanks Kaisa.”
— Joanna G.
“Great workout!”

“Absolutely love Kaisa! First workout and I loved it”
— Chantel G.

“I am so grateful for this Just Move program! Almost a year in - this has allowed me to workout at home, pretty consistently, and I never did or thought I could. The variety is wonderful and the instructors are the best. These movements feel so good in my body after some consistent pain from other workouts as well as too much sitting :( I’m able to move almost pain free again! I credit this membership for providing me a way to take breaks from work, and prepare to do lawn work or house work, all while feeling much better. It helps with my energy level too. Thanks for making this all available- in categories and length of time options. Bonus: Kaisa continues to inspire me in so many ways 💝”
— Nicole C.
“First time attempting Kaisa, after following for a few years. I decided to leave one program and trainer to come here. This workout gives me a different perspective. The meaning of movement is what I feel. I am an there and I perform at high levels in my workouts, this definitely was enjoyable. Thank you Coach K!!!!!”
— Nancy C.

— Lisa H.
“This was my first time doing this workout and I loved it! It was the perfect pace to get me moving on a Sunday morning.”
— Susan D.
“The 20/20 Workouts have rapidly become my go to morning workout. Fast and intense. I start the day feeling great after this movement!”
— Leah H.
“Oh!! That was a fun one!”
— Mary K.
“All I can really say to Kaisa and team is THANK YOU! Your workouts have been a game changer for me and, potentially, a life saver. I was an athlete when I was younger, but shifts in my life style, a rough pregnancy, and a terrible car accident caused me to loose so much of my strength and mobility. I've tried numerous times to reintegrate movement into my life, but most programs were just not accessible for me. The embarrassment of not being able to get through the WARM UP portion of a workout was so discouraging and often I would push myself too far and end up injured and back at square one. The START series you have created is PERFECT for someone like me who truly needs to start at the beginning and develop a strong core foundation before moving on to more advanced workouts. Kaisa does an amazing job cheering you on and makes you feel like she is really there with you and is proud of your progress. I am so excited to be on this journey and to have this team helping me through it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!”
— Amber N.

— Shevan D.

“I was looking for a short, simple and targeted workout. I am not pregnant, but this 10 min workout was perfect. The instruction by Shab had great cues and I definitely feel like I had a bit of a workout. I am taking a trip soon and will revisit this one for sure. Bands are easy to pack.”
— Lynne M.
“This was a perfect, quick, first thing in the morning workout!”

— Gray O.
“I loved this workout! Would love to see more "athletic"-move centered/themed workouts. I was a competitive athlete for most of my life and have fallen out of the routine of it. This workout was a great way to get back into feeling more like myself - i just wish there were more workouts like this!”
— Katlyn R.
“I love this! It’s a progression from the other Start Mobility workouts using the chair, and I love it! It allows me to do more challenging moves carefully as I get stronger and more mobile. I’m a relatively strong yet somewhat unfit person with a big belly. The use of the chair helps make some moves more doable (when my belly is on the way), it helps me build strength and makes me feel great about myself cause I’m able to do more difficult moves. Thank you so much for this! Please create more of these mobility workouts using the chair but add more difficult moves! ❤️❤️❤️”
— Kathleen S.
“Loved the workout, i like it with the kettlebells. Would-be be nice if the stretching was in real time”
— Jeroen D.

“Perfect to get me back on strength focus. Ashley’s voice tone and ‘realness’ is so motivating. It flew by and felt good. The toxins are now flowing out and away from me!!”
— Eugenie C.
“One of my favorite workouts I do! Gets my heart going and the sweat dripping!”
— Katie R.

“Workouts for all levels (from beginner to advanced), with or without equipment, and from 10-40 minutes. The perfect "go to" when I don´t have much time, but need to get my body moving :) It´s been a lifesaver during the pandemic as my gym were closed for 8 months, and although I´m back at my crossfit box now, I pop by on busy days when I won´t make it to the gym.”
— Heidi Lois R.
“Fantastic workout! Great for the time poor Sweat dripping of me. Kaisia smashed me. But in great way.”
— Julie C.
“Great mobility workout when you have limited time!”
— Maureen O.
“I love love love Just Move ! I subscribed since the beginning, 2 y ago I think ! Kaisa and the other instructors teached me moves that I use on a daily basis.

— Joy M.
“Starting from complete scratch or negative scratch LOL - head to toe tight tight tight. Beginning my day with this short invigorating stretches feels amazing. Baby steps but looking forward to adding more and more of Just Move routines to my day. Would love to be able to save specific videos to a library rather than needing to search each time I log in (or did I miss this feature?)...Thank you so much!”
— Diane M L.
“I’m just a beginner at yoga and have tried many beginner videos, but Ashish explains everything very concretely and clearly. I would love more beginner yoga classes with him that are longer, like 45-60+ minutes, because I always feel I could do a couple more flows after the 30-40 minute ones, yet, I am unable to do the complicated poses like circle and boat. So lengthier beginner classes would be a great welcome. Ashish is wonderful.”
— Nancy M.
“Great way to start my morning!”
— Michael C.
“Awesome workout, really helps to relax the shoulders. Ready to start the das!”

— Rachel K.
“I love JUST MOVE! This programme has helped me slowly gain back my fitness and joy of movement during my battle with long covid. Covid took me from my peak fitness to not even being able to do a 10 minute walk. I reclaimed my movement with the start programme, then beginner, and now mobility. It took me 7 months of preservance with JUST MOVE to get back to comfortably working out 4-5 times a week. The gentle encouragement and kind words of the instructors was a much needed balm. I enjoy the variety of workouts and trainers. I appreciate the positive self talk used, and the overall encouragement for making it to the mat. I like that the workouts are not too long and equipment is minimal. It feels personal even though it's online! Thank you for giving me this afforfable and quality option. Keep up the fantastic work!”
— Mohsina P.
“Great pace and movements. Definitely felt entire body working.”
— Michelle T.
“I love everything about KaisaFit and Just Move. I'm 50 and am trying to stay active and keep moving. It's been hard to find an online program that gets me sweating and helps me get stronger safely ... I have often ended up with injuries that then keep me from exercising, which is really frustrating. With Just Move I work hard but never harm myself. I started with Mobility classes but now feel confident trying different types - they all feel safe and strengthening. Thank you!”

THANK YOU!”

— Tamera W.
“I’ve been neglecting my movement and exercise due to workload stress over the past few months and today I woke up and decided after a cuppa that it was time to break the drought. So I pulled out the mat and the hand weights and sifted through the 30 minute program selection from my Just Move subscription and did cardio dumbbells with Kaisa. Whoo! I’m alive and feelin’ the burn! Thanks Kaisa! It was good to be back!”

“I LOVE the Just Move library. These are great, efficient, at home workouts for any level. Particularly right now as I'm getting over Covid and can't get into the gym yet, I'm relying on these workouts to help get me back into moving! They also are a great switch-up from my regular strength or circuit routines when I need something new. I love the moves and the instructors, they are always fun, and I can make the workout as easy or hard as I need to (within reason given the weights I have at home). Everything I've tried in this library has been great quality!”
— Lorelle B.
“My hips are so tight - I try to limit sitting at work, but those hips are still singing! The Just Move program meets me where I’m at each day. If I have only 10 minutes in the morning, there is still value in having a guided routine to loosen up. Some days I spend longer and focus on strength or cardio. I’m never disappointed in the end. I feel challenged, but my self esteem remains in tact.”
— Katharine G.

— Debbie S.
“Hi Kaisa, I'm currently doing a 30 day program intermediate and I love the workouts. I have Osteoarthritis in both hips. I have a hip replacement in my right hip which feels great! The left hip will need to be done but I wanted to get myself healthy and strong before I do that. I have limited movement in my left hip so I make sure not to push that side too much but work on strengthening it. I'm very happy I found you on Instagram and join the Kaisa movement because each day I feel happier and stronger. Thank you, Deborah”

“Checking in for day 1. I the Kaisa suite! Just got into a serious car accident and was looking forward to heading back to the gym. Since I cannot go for now, I am taking this opportunity to reactivate my body with some low intensity movement and gradually get myself back to heavy workouts. I give it a 3 because I would love to see something in here that pays attention to our ankles and wrists. Since Kaisa mentioned that a lot of us are sitting for work, that includes stiff ankles and over active wrists on computers. Those are two parts of the body I find stretches always ignore; yet, they do get very painful. Thanks Kaisa team for the great content! Im lookng forward to seeing how this helps me recover from the accident impact.”
— LaToya O.

“I am loving these yoga start videos! I am not new to yoga, but I had spinal fusion 5 years ago and find some of these chair poses so helpful for getting some of my range of motion back correctly. I wish I would have found this earlier, but I am excited to keep working with these videos.”

“I’m no runner, but I’ve been walking in the mountains yesterday and will do so again tomorrow, so I thought this strength workout might be good in between. Anyway I always love the variety of new videos! I was a bit scared of the length since I had a tough month at work and been only doing 15min workouts for the past weeks. It was ideal though, I could play a bit with the weights but otherwise got through all circuits and reps and hardly noticed the time! As always Kasia keeps me motivated and entertained enough to follow through and not give up with the first sweat pearls appearing… Now being on holidays I hope to get back fully on track again with longer and intermediate videos, too. Having been doing this program for way over a year already (and can count the days without still on my fingers and toes) I just signed up for another year! Keep it coming, please!”

I used to hate sports. everytime, I tried to motivate myself by exercising more the fitness programm was never for true begginers and I just gave up after the first day. The Just move program, and all of Kaisa's start videos are absolutely amazing and actually great for true begginers like me ! I did no sport for 20 years +, now I'm exercising almost everyday.

“I started doing Kaisa Fit workouts in October 2020. I needed to find something after trying to return to my gym to swim and not feeling comfortable. I follow Kaisa on IG and was inspired by the spinets of workouts she posts, so I tried it out. Kaisa Fit workouts have been life changing for me. Before joining Kaisa Fit, I never worked out at home. I never knew I could move my body the way I can now, nor did I know I would enjoy it! I look forward to waking up every morning to do a workout. I love the variety that is offered and I love the challenges. It helps make the decision for me of what workout to try next and also takes me out of my comfort zone with trying new things. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Kaisa. I feel strong and empowered.”

She is fun, personable, and very motivating and upbeat. I like that she focuses on body mechanics and health -- her workouts aren't just focused on burning calories or getting a "beach body" although don't get me wrong, her workouts kick ass and burn calories too. I'm a fit multi sport athlete and I find her style refreshing, unique, and have learned a lot about mobility and movement in just a handful of sessions already. Her program is a wonderful accompaniment to a lifting or running program.”

It's been a while since I've tuned into KasiaFit but within minutes I felt both at ease and encouraged to push through the discomfort. What I love about Kasia's style and focus it that even after several months with little to no workouts I am feeling safe. I trust that her focus on joint mobility will help to oil those sticky joints and get me moving smoothly once again. I love the total body focus on every exercise and really enjoy Kasia's energy and teaching style. THANK YOU!”
— Lisa R.
“Great workout! Loved the coach. Feedback would be that it was confusing during the first round of each set when he was demonstrating the moves in the set that we were supposed to be doing a full set at that time. It seemed like the set was going to start after the demo but it was already ongoing. Personally I would prefer the demo & then start the set afterwards (more clearly). Other than that it was great.”

I walk away feeling strong, mobile, rejuvenated, and with a positive self-image.”

I have tried multiple excellent online fitness programs but not one of them combined all of the elements I need to maintain overall body health--cardio, strength, core, AND mobility. I got in on Kaisa Fit when it was just Kaisa and LOVED it--I didn't think it could get even better--but. it. has.

“As a very very lazy person who can't stand going to the gym, but also desperately needs to be more active for my health, I am loving Just Move. I can do things at my own pace, in the comfort and privacy of my own home, and the instructors are all so encouraging and kind, and most importantly, focused on things like form, being in touch with how a movement makes you feel, and mobility. I feel like my form has improved, and I'm not groaning when i get off the couch anymore, which is crucial! I feel stronger, and more motivated. I love that the lessons are all different lengths, some days I feel more motivated than others, and there's something there for all those days.”

— Jain V.
“Lots of great options depending on goals or what I feel up for in the moment. New content and instructors added consistently. I would like to see more community interaction, times when we can feel more like a group/workout together or participation in challenges over time - for now it's a very reliable place to find great workouts whether I have 10 or 30ish minutes.”
— Lindsay Flis S.
“So far, I have been absolutely in love with the different options for movement and the different instructors. There's a great amount of variety!”
— Emily S.

“Great! Perfect short little workout! I was getting so crabby at work and just needed to move. This was great. Didn't sweat too much (it went fast) but definitely moved my body. I like how she explained things. I can always do with more hip work. Thanks!”
— B Michelle J.
“Thank you for being who you are and for these incredible workouts! I'm just 3 days in and I already feel amazing (and also like I'm part of your TEAM!) Your smile and encouraging comments keep me going the entire time! Can't wait to explore everything you have to offer! Thank you!”
— Kristin A.
“love the variety of the workouts, not only in theme but also in time. i know i can log on and get a great workout if I only have 15 minutes or if I have 45. the ratings for difficulty are spot on and even the beginner sessions are well thought out and leave you feeling energized.”
— Kristine C.
“Good warm up!!!”
— Desa O.
“Amazing workout! I've been meaning to mention this to the Just Move team, but I absolutely LOVE this platform and the fact that all workouts do NOT have music included in them is THE BEST. I put my favorite tunes on in the background and press play to my chosen workout and here we go! Thank you very much Kaisa for your love of movement and for sharing it with us through this platform and through various other great coaches.”
— Marie-Ève M.
“So challenging!”
— Amity B.
“This was the best shoulder opener. My shoulders and neck are often tight and these moves real helped in releasing them. Thank you!”
— Veronica J.
“fantastic library of workouts. Thanks for the new runner's workouts too. Looking forward to seeing the difference these make for me. Keep up the fab work. Andrea. Lake District, UK.”

— Anthony M.
“Love the energy you bring to the workout. Also it is so fab that your workout is a ‘true’ starting point to getting back into exercise. I totally enjoy this and I will continue these exercises. Thank you”
— Cara B.
“Ok, day 2 done. I honestly I have not moved in years and am incredibly unfit. This video was supportive and helpful. I particularly liked when Kaiser explained the shaking muscles! I did day one too!”
— Caroline f.
“Excellent workout for tight hips!”
— Gina S.
“LOVE the quick pace & challenging movements of this! After half an hour I really feel like I got a satisfying workout. Brittany is such an excellent mix of encouraging and pushing to challenge yourself. A+!”
— Emily J.

“Great starting my Just Move journey! Very easy to follow, enough of a challenge but not intimidating! Look forward to the next challenge and keeping up the momentum. So glad to have found this site.”
— Bernadette G.
“Just completed Day 2. I am loving this! The instruction as I follow along is perfect and Kaisa is so encouraging and enthusiastic. I feel like I am doing this one on one in the same room with a coach. There is a terrific variety of classes and I can hardly wait to try all of them. Thanks Kaisa!”
— Dana A.
“Great way to begin exercising again! Loved the stretching! Instructions were clear. Great personality!”
— Gail J.
“Your instructions and enthusiasm are grand! You are knowledgeable and wise!”
— Karen J.

“Best money I spent all pandemic long. Seriously. I can always find a workout that matches my energy level, mood, and space, and I love the diversity of instructors. Is it weird that I am more motivated when the instructor is breathing and sweating as much as I am? If so, so be it! Also, the constant reminder to respect where you're at is very much appreciated. :)”
— Paula Jean H.
“greatl love itl”

— Abbey D.
“Just Move has a great variety of classes available and pushes you without judgement or shaming (I hate the shaming).”
— Megan C.
“I liked how easy these moves were and realized wow its a great way to also get out of the bed and do a quick stretch in the mornings before starting the day. Will make this one a daily routine.”
— Ajoke B.
“The deadlifts challenged me. I've never done them with a hold at the bottom and felt a good burn. I've always struggled with the one-legged dead lifts and found the tip about pulling in the belly button really made a difference. Excellent workout!”
— Karen M.

“Loving Just Move. Gentle, but effective, workout. I’m 68 and have had both hips replaced, the last one 8 years ago. So, I am super conscious of not doing anything too strenuous on them. Many exercise programs for seniors are not challenging enough for me. This one is! And I’m doing burpees that get my heart rate up without getting on the floor! Thank you, Kaisa!❤️”
— Edwina K.
“Really great, this is helping me ease back into using weights as part of my home workouts. More 20 minute range of beginner dumbbells would be great (and Intermediate too!)”
— Leah R.
“Having the motivation to exercise has always been a struggle for me, and I’ve fallen in and out of exercise for my entire life. I’ve had stints where I have worked out regularly and then I have gone years where I haven’t done anything at all. I’ve had success with group classes, but independently going to the gym or working out at home has always been a challenge. I was skeptical that KaisaFit would work for me, but I decided to give it a try. In January 2021, I purchased the Home Workout bundle. Then, when it launched in April, I became a Just Move member. And, I have been loving it. Now that I have the program, I move my body every day. I’ve moved for thousands of minutes and it has benefitted both my physical and my mental health--especially during COVID-related lockdowns. I love that there are so many different workouts to choose from varying in length and style; you can do them on their own or combine them to make a longer workout. I love the diversity of instructors who are all engaging and qualified--so you don’t need to worry about hurting yourself due to poor information or cueing. I love that the team is always adding to and updating the platform, listening to member feedback, and supporting members as needed. And, I love the community that has built up around the platform. Thank you, Kaisa and Team for developing this platform. I look forward to continuing to move with you!”
— Danielle D.
“Hi there, I'm a true beginner, and while I've enjoyed your mobility workouts, sometimes I feel like the change between movements is a bit too fast for me to follow. I can get there, but I'm just not as quick as you can because I'm definitely not as bendy! :-) Just something to think about...”
— Sarah R.
“I love this warmup - and the warmup series in general. Really left me feeling great, and ready for a tough strength workout.”
— Sharilynn W.
“Beautiful practice to wake up your body. I really enjoyed this!”
— Ann U.
“Wow, I started the beginner 30 day challenge as I haven’t been consistent with training for a couple months however previous to that period of time I trained consistently 5-6 days a week and “trained hard and fast”. This beginner program is outstanding! The workouts and cues during movements are brilliant, structure of movement plan has flowed really well and meals are tasty. 5 stars from me and really enjoying AND feeling my movement in all the right places haha. Thanks TEAM Kaisa! x”
— Alice P.
“Great so far… rehabbing from a bad ankle break, sloth-like behavior due to pandemic and WFH. Looking forward to getting back some strength and flexibility.”
— Dana M.
“Love the challenge and the flow of the routine. I would have like the Kease "go team" or "yes team" spirit a few times. But over all it was 👍 👍 👍 I will revisit this workout.”
— Susan T.
“I have been following Kaisa and doing her entire online program since it was available. The only thing missing was some yoga classes and some smaller workouts to add in when I was short on time. When "Just Move" became available it was a no brainer to enroll. It is organized perfectly, you can search by time for workouts, type of workout, or follow a challenge they create. I love that I can do 30 minutes of strength and then switch right over to an athletic recovery within a minute and not waste time searching for what I want or going to a different platform! Thank you Kaisa and team for being amazing. You are so enjoyable and an amazing coach.”
— Marina L.

“You're amazing! Thank you”
— Neringa G.
“One of my faves!!! Thanks.”
— Liz D.
“This workout was AHMAZZZZZINGGG. So fun, so simple and yet so rare! I loved using a household item in a new way. Class was over before I knew it!!”
— Laura B.

“I get overwhelmed by endless YouTube fitness channels and even the monthly fitness subscriptions. JUST MOVE is perfect because it gives you guides on how to structure my workouts, so I'm not just doing random videos. I like that each workout has mobility/warm up/cool down built-in so it's fully complete and I don't have to think about it. I also like that it has separate warm-ups and cool-downs so I can have them when I do workouts at the gym instead.”
— Taylor M.
“Loved this workout and how Kaisa was vulnerable and shared how much she also needs this community to continue to move and take care of her body. I love how intense and mindful this workout was. Kaisa has become my favorite workout buddy during the pandemic and her mobility exercises and wisdom has helped me relieve chronic shoulder, back and hip pain.”
— Emma F.
“Great overall workout! Easy to follow ! Got a Good sweat on!”
— Donnette F.
“Loved it! Felt my legs muscles working!”
— Nilka A.
“When I was younger I was really active but after an accident, I was forced to scale my activity back significantly. These videos seem so basic, but they make me realize how important it is to get these small moves exactly right. Thanks for taking the time to detail each movement in an educational, encouraging but never demeaning manner. This is exactly what I need to help with my recovery!!!”
— Pamela D.
“This is my first workout after a veryong hiatus. I thoroughly enjoyed it and worked up a sweat without overexertion. Can't wait to see what's next!!”
— Renee D.
“awesome class, great verbal cues”
— Cynthia S.
“This is the one membership that I have been able to consistently use!!! I started with the June challenge and I'm still going strong! I love the variety in the workouts and in instructors. I feel challenged enough but not overworked to the point of injury. I have mobility challenges but I am able to work through them rehabilitate and get better. Plus a lot of workouts are just fun!”
— Ena H.
“The Strength Complex might be my favourite workout so far. Feels great to add weights back into my routine. But I'm loving the variety of options every morning too!”
— Jessica W.
“Kaisa- Just Move membership gives you a range of exercises for all your needs. I use it mostly to work on mobility before and after sessions. You will notice the difference.”
— maggy v.
“This seriously got me sweating! Taking 30 minutes out of my day to get this much work in on the mat was so gratifying. I can feel myself getting stronger in those no hands push ups. Just moving even 15 minutes a day I'm seeing progress in my energy and ability.”
— Sophia M.
“Excellent beginner's workout! I had to modify a little bit due to a bruised bone, but I'm still super sweaty!”
— Sandy W.
“Just Move has the most variety of workouts and levels I've ever seen! I know her programs are safe and thoughtfully/thoroughly constructed. I'm so grateful I found Kaisa almost 2 years ago!”
— Cathy S.

“Love it”

“All of Kaisa’s workouts and the Just Move series are the BEST in home workouts! It doesn’t matter if you have 5 mins or an hour, if you are a beginner or advanced. Each workout and stretch will push you and you feel so accomplished afterwards.”
— Katie A.
“I have been an athletic person for the majority of my life. But sometimes eating becomes more fun. Especially when pandemics take over the world and your forced to put your business on hold and you turn to food. There is literally a workout for everyone here. I am jumping back in with the Start Challenge. I knew it was going to be easier, but with a hip injury I wanted to make sure I took things slow and easy. Just finished day 4 and I broke a sweat.”
— Tara B.

“I LOVED LOVED LOVED Feel good flow! It was the perfect way to de-stress after sitting at my desk all day! This will be a regular part of my practice!”

— Barb H.

“Been wanting to do Kaisa's mobility program for years now, decided to join the June challenge to mix up my workout routine that I was doing for 3+ years. My body has thanked me! I slowed way down and listened to my body and mobility has made me feel strong. The new moves have made me proud of my body for being able to do different things. Kaisa's way of training is so motivating, helpful and effective. So glad I got it for a year to try ALL of her workouts!”
— Kayti C.

“What are you waiting for? Kaisa and the team are amazing and so encouraging! There are so many great things about JUST MOVE! My favourites are all the ways you can move based on how you’re feeling. Who knew dance could be so much fun?!? Perhaps the best thing, all the levels available to meet you where you’re at. Thank you for creating this space!”
— Mamie S.
“I joined Just Move to participate in the June challenge, and I've loved it! I like the variety of workouts that are available, the fact that there are different trainers, and I especially like that there are workouts of different lengths available- it makes it easy to fit movement into your day, even if you don't have much time.”
— Erika W.
“So much fun, nice & quick even my 2yr old joined in on some of the moves 👌”
— Kaleena B.
“Kaisa and Just Move showed up in my life when I needed it the most. I purchased my first bundle about a year ago and fell in love with Kaisa, her workouts, her perspective and authenticity. So when the opportunity came to purchase a membership, it was a no brainer. The workouts are so fun, the trainers are a breath of fresh air. Mentally, physically, emotionally… this is something that I needed and benefit from every single day.”
— Amber K.
“I love this workout - as a 50 something who had a C-section at 39, I was struggling with other beginner core workouts but this one is really helping me nail the basics. I do it weekly and can feel my core strength building, which is helping the other workouts, especially the ones involving balance. As Kaisa says, form over anything!”
— Helena F.
“I love all things kaisa fit! The variety of workout options and the focus on joint health and mobility is perfect for all levels of fitness.”

— Kathryn P.
“Thanks”
— Joshua M.
“Thanks”

“I really like Andrew's teaching style..He relates well to all abilities and uses whispering for emphasis. Question: how to modify for arthritic wrists and hands?”
— Ginny H.
“I love it!!!! I feel like I am definitely getting my money’s worth here…every time I workout with Kaisa or any of the trainers, I feel like I WORKED OUT! Thank you for giving of yourselves, I feel amazing!”
— Josephine P.
“Week one completed and I am finding it very easy to stay focused and exercise daily. I am starting each day with either a Yoga or Mobility workout, and then a cardio or strength workout in the evening. This approach to exercise suits my lifestyle as it fits in around everything else I have going on. Great start!!”
— Rachel M.
“I am really enjoying Just Move! I am a Pilates and Movement teacher and I have been looking for a membership site that I can have an hour to myself as a student, have fun, and just move. This has become my favorite time to myself to start my day and am so happy Kaisa put this together. I love Kaisa's workouts and how she takes the time to break down the exercises; fantastic instructor. I also absolutely love Aaliyah Earvin, her energy is awesome and I would love to see more videos from her! I felt like I was in the room working out with her.<3”

— Stacey G.
“I’m on week Two of the June Challenge, Intermediate. I am loving it. Love the diversity & love that there are different guest instructors for a bit of variety in trainers as well as moves. By the way, I am 69 years old & not having a problem with the Intemediate workout. Just saw there is an Advanced workout week that now, since I am a year member, will be doing at the end of the June Challenge. Keep the workouts coming.”
— Louise M.
“I loved !”

— Cynthia M.
“Awesome!!”
— elizabeth c.
“I am a breath away from 51 & it’s been 2 years since I’ve worked out regularly. I was going to jump in & probably hurt myself by doing workout that I am not ready for. This beginners series is PERFECT. I am feeling really good but not hurting myself getting back into regular exercise. Fun & motivating! Thank you 😊”
— Nancy D.
“short and sharp, awesome..”
— emma f.
“I have an erratic schedule, and the way the workouts are organized and labeled help me find workout that will fit the time/energy that I have at the moment. FUN workouts! I've been getting into dumbbells, and I'm really enjoying the options on Just Move. I'm looking forward to trying a dance class!”
— JoEllen Y.
“I started on my fitness journey using other videos to get me started and when I moved to Kaisafit I saw the inches begin to fall off and the physical changes in my body. This journey has been tough but because I found this site with different level workouts it has made it that much easier. Kaisa’s energy is electric and she keeps me coming back for more. I love it!”
— Mischon W.
“I am so pleased with the variety of workouts in the growing Just Move library. There is something for whatever mood I’m in that day, and for whatever length of time I have available. I appreciate Kaisa’s cheerful yet very professional demeanor and also that of the other coaches. I’m definitely getting my money’s worth with my membership. Thanks and keep it growing!”
— Ann J.
“Just getting back into strength training after surgery 4 weeks ago today. Did what I could, learned some new warm up exercises and nice pacing of exercises. Love Kaisa’s positive personality!”
— Abbe S.
“Nice flow. I feel stretched and accomplished! Loved the brevity of the program. Helps me to start my day with confidence I helped my body do something good and help avoid injury. The mobility routines help me go about my day feeling more flexible, less pain, more endurance and safer. Thanks!”
— Judy C.
“Challenging finisher!”
— Melanie B.
“Signed up for Just Move membership today and did the Feel Good Yoga Flow (had been experiencing some exercise burnout) and It was so rejuvenating. My primary reason for joining Just Move, after having gone over their free content was, that each trainer took time to explain the movement and the correct form, before moving into practicing it with you. So they'll explain the movement/asana, take 20-30 seconds AND THEN do it with you. They weren't trying to fit in as many movements as possible within a 25-30 minute window. It came across more like, even if we do just 5 movements, let's do them with a proper understanding of the correct form rather than doing 20 exercises with poor form, which was so refreshing to see. I have tried a ton of subscriptions. Some more expensive than this and some cheaper. But in all of them except Just Move and another one, trainers just didn't take the time to explain the form. Suffice it to say, you'll even be explained something as simple as a hinge by Kaisa in a workout video, so we are in good hands.”
— Radhika A.
“I am doing the Just Move June month of movement challenge. I am coming back to doing regular exercise after falling into bad habits of being very inactive following an injury. I have found the beginners series to be a good mix of challenging but easy movements. I love the focus on balance and core. I always get a sweat on! I would recommend this to anyone getting started and want to move more in their day. My alarm goes off and I am happy to jump out of bed and start my day with Kaisa.”
— Kelda R.
“Thank You !!!”
— Iva B.
“I previously purchased the Mobility videos and absolutely have loved incorporating them into my weekly workout routine. I purchased the Just Move Membership and have been thoroughly pleased with this purchase. It is a tough workout but even after just one week I feel so good! I have more energy and look forward to each daily video. Im so glad I made the jump to purchase this package!”
— Ashley Y.
“Loved this workout”
— karen L.
“Great way to wake up and a good first video to get back into my fitness journey.”
— Jennelle H.
“I needed this June reset. I am loving the mix of classes both in length/difficulty/and focus. So grateful to be moving my body and though I have been sore - it has been that good kind of sore that your body is proud of you and hopeful that you are going to keep this up! Thank you!”
— Kimberly C.
“I'm enjoying the variety of movement and instruction styles, as well as the diversity of the instructors themselves. Instruction always feels supportive and kind. The movements are challenging, while the personalities and attitudes never are. I feel motivated to keep coming back. I used to feel guilty if I missed a workout, which was really unhealthy. Now I feel sad if I miss a day, because I know I'm missing something I enjoy. What a difference the right attitude makes.”
— Sara S.
“After too long away from workouts, this was a lovely, encouraging, and adaptable reentry! It’s only 30 minutes, give it a go!”
— Anna J.
“I finally took the plunge and signed up because of the June Challenge and I am SO happy I did. I feel completely reinvigorated and excited to work out again. There are a ton of different types of workouts at different experience levels and the instructors all give good prompts and variations. It feels like a fun "choose you own adventure" platform and that variety and the enthusiasm of all the coaches makes it fun to try new things in a low pressure way.”
— Erin M.
“Really enjoyed the stories during the workout ☺️”
— Amanda G.
“Love all the memberships and this four week challenge. Wonderful instructor for this wake up yoga.”
— Barri M.
“I love these mobility workouts! They make such a huge difference to my strength, flexibility, and overall health. I tore an ACL ten years ago and thought I would never be able to do squats again, or even any leg exercises that called for a lot of lunging or knee bends. KaisaFit changed all that! I’m more mobile and stronger than ever! Great workouts!”
— Helen M.

“Quick but a killer. Loved it. Hard enough for a single workout on recovery day or when I'm short on time but short enough to add to another mobility session.”
— Courtney R.
“Love it”
— Sara H.
“Amazing! Slow and easy wins this race ...”
— Karen K.
“Perfect for every level! Currently doing the Beginner June Challenge and, after 10 months of sciatica and lumbar surgery in April, this is literally perfect for my needs. Thank you so much!!”
— CeXochitl D.
“great cardio workout for a beginner.”
— Kayla R.

— Desserai Z.
“Day 1- done! Feels good & I really appreciate the winning slow start as the tortoise always wins the race ;)”

“Love his energy!”
— MaryBeth A.
“I love just move so much! All the instructors have such a great vibe and the overall content has so much variety. It even have dance workouts. Which makes it fun for me, I can switch up and keep movement as a part of my life everyday. I love, love, love this membership so much! Thank you Kaisa for having this option:)”
— Amber T.

“Great session. It would have been good to have a bit more balance of core and cardio. Cardio was on point but not enough core, but I did still enjoy it.”
— Denise J.
“Excellent strength training and balance workout!!!”
— Elainena E.
“I am loving this Challenge! Such an amazing way to start each day. I'm already hooked! Kaisa is the BEST coach. I love being part of a team!!!!”

“Awesome workout. Makes the core feel alive and gets some great stretching in too. Feeling the burn!!”
— Chris C.
“This is my first Kaisa Fit workout! I feel tired and sweaty, but also great! I am not a beginner in regards to form, but have not exercised in a long time and have gained some weight. These were challenging enough to definitely be worth my while, but for not having worked out in a while, I had to make a few modifications - especially in regards to the moves that required balance on one foot/leg. I had a chair close for when I could not keep my balance. Thank you for the encouragement.”
— Rebecca R.
“So inspiring! Thank you!”
— Renee K.
“It‘s a really fun way to move”
— Lina G.
“For all of my KaisaFit purchases, it’s the best money spent ever on fitness. I used to go to the gym, spend countless hours on the treadmill and weight machines with little or no change to my body. I started using Kaisa’s routines, regularly, starting in October 2020. I have built up so much more strength, seen a change in my body and mind and now I can’t go without a day moving! Thank you, Kaisa and team for putting out great content, caring about the folks who use your products and just putting yourself out there!”
— Doris H.
“Loved this workout and love the instructor!!! She went slowly and was encouraging throughout the exercise routine.”
— Lisa W.
“I keep waiting to not love one of these videos but Calli made that impossible. I really appreciate his calm yet motivating energy - he has such a gift!”
— Mairi B.
“I love Kaisa's positivity in all her training. There are so many options depending on what your body feels like doing. I love mobility and stretching now and try to find time for some movement every day. Really enjoying training with all Kaisa's friends too.”
— Ali B.
“I love the idea of you walking us through a video like this (with the more basic floor movements); however, I am wondering if you might be able to throw out an "alternative" movement (/modification) just in case some body cannot do a move you're doing? For example, I am almost positive that I have ab separation (diastasis recti) from having two babies, so that first [and last] start up/cool down movements where you roll actually caused my ab muscle (don't know which one, exactly) to cramp up (totally not blaming you, I didn't even know that would happen!)...and, I also have discovered that performing the "superman" movement causes my sciatic to pinch...based on those examples, might you be able to recommend some mods during a flow, possibly? I realize that it would be very difficult to offer a mod for every move during a flow for those "just in case" moments/people, but just thought I'd ask...obviously, we have to do what is best for each of us on an individual bases, but ya never know unless you ask, right?! haha. Thank you for your time and consideration; overall, I enjoyed this mobility/movement experience.”
— Lisa Marie L.
“I’ve really enjoyed every single workout that I’ve done from the library. I love how strong and agile I’m feeling - thanks Kaisa and team”
— Nicole J.
“I really enjoyed the workout. It felt creative and the right amount of exertion. I prefer when instructors "mirror" so when they say right, it looks like my right. In general, I am finding the instructors on this site say "Yaaas Team!!" WAY TOO MUCH. It sounds like Yaas Queen!”
— Katherine W.
“This is my 3rd workout for the day after a Mobility & Core workout for a total of 1 hour, which is my target. Thanks Kaisa for the effort you put into these videos, they're exactly what I need. Love Safiya”
— Safiya A.
“Feel so good after the mobility session 👌🏻”
— Martina W.
“it was soo good, a huge energy boost, and Paris is really funny. I hope there will be other lessons like this. :)”
— Alexandra P.

“The absolute best go to for motivation!!!”
— Marisa E.
“Just Move has been a staple in my exercise repertoire since it launched. As someone with a relatively toxic "exercise-to-lose-weight" past, JustMove has been a breathe of fresh air, providing me with the choices based on my body's desire that day to really...just move. The instructors are incredible and each workout leaves me with new knowledge of self, body, mind, and even soul. Be it cardio yoga, body build-up (that one - phewf!), or cardio dumbells, I am left feeling stronger, more in tune with my body and aligned internally. I am really grateful toKaisa and the team for this series, especially in this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, to offer such a menu of options to really suit anyone's needs and desires without shame, toxic body positivity, or weight-loss rhetoric. THANK YOU!”
— Monica H.
“I loved this intro into strength training and Kaisa saying "good job team." So thankful I invested in myself to "Just Move!"”
— Kristine S.
“It would be nice if there was a timer at the bottom of the screen during timed intervals. Also, i think the trainers should do the whole workout with us... not stand up and talk through the workout!”
— Patti B.
“Getting started today, what a great video. Absolutely spot on for the first day. Just right!! Well done Kaisa, you nailed it!”
— Tracy D.
“I started doing mobility work with Kaisa's programs about 6 months ago now and I can't say enough good things. Sports related injuries when I was younger and having hyper mobile hips makes me prone to certain injuries. Now in my 30's being active just seemed to have more cons than pros, i was constantly injuring something then having to take weeks off to recuperate and started feeling really hopeless. Kaisa's programs not only help my joints feel better but also sparked that love of movement again. I also bought the Just Move app and through those workouts have felt confident enough to go back to a gym(its been at least 10 years). Honestly cannot recommend enough. I don't know how she does it but it feels like you've really got Coach Kaisa there cheering you through the work.”
— Aubrey A.
“Love this! As with many things as we move through this pandemic, my gym is not offering many of the same classes I used to take pre-Covid, even though they are open. I'm so thankful for Just Move and the great variety of workouts to keep me moving!”
— Lynette C.

“As a person starting over after a year of inactivity, I truly appreciate the beginner level activity. It helped me get my body used to moving again without the paralyzing soreness that I was expecting. Don’t get me wrong, I felt the workout during and after but in a way that left me wanting more. You never feel like you cannot accomplish your movement goal for the day!”
— Jessica C.

“I am loving all the Just Move workouts. I love that there is such a range of activities to choose from and it's easy to commit to doing at least 20 minutes of movement a day. I seem to be in a constant state of injury - running, swimming, climbing - and the movement and body weight workouts have really helped keep my joints happy. I am also doing more yoga than I have in 10 years because 1) the instructors rock (option to smile!) and 2) it's so much easier to fit in 20-40 minutes than the typical studio class of 60-90 minutes.”
— Elena E.
“Love these. Just enough to get me to sweat, but still gentle on my healing body. Thank you!!”
— Lisa M M.
“I love the options. I like that there is a suggestion for each day, but if I’m not feeling it or have a different time allotment I pick from the library. The library is sorted into categories that help narrow the selection by time or activity or coach. And the mobility work is exceptional. The workouts generally include a brief warm up and cool down which is great to keep me from skipping it when rushing to tick the box. Oh and the coaches and workouts are excellent. Get in, get out. Lots of good vibes. Value packed!”
— Tangela H.
“Love it, love it, love it!! So many options on hand, it never gets boting! Thank you Kaisa!”
— Heidi S.
“my absolute favorite!”
— Kataa K.
“Love it!”
— Armelle A.
“I really appreciated the conversation around making your body your friend. I also very much enjoy the balancing moves.”
— Megan K.
“There are no words for how much I love Just Move, Kaisa, and her ENTIRE team! I use these workouts as a warm up to my yoga, and it has been a game changer as far as my mobility during my asana practice. The massive diversity of movement styles has kept me super engaged, as well. Movement is medicine, and this is worth every penny.”
— Samantha P.
“I love ALL the workouts. And the fact that I can do this at home. Thank you.”
— Kitta A.
“there are a few workouts that have become my all times - partly b/c they're so fun and mix mobility with strength and cardio, but also b/c there's ways to modify to make them harder or easier depending on my day. i love that there are short ones i can do alone or mix together. and i truly love the diversity of voices and approaches, so even though some aren't for me, some SO ARE. love y'all.”
— AJ S.
“I LOVE IT!!!! It has really made a change in my life, in my body and my health. I feel strong and healthy with a lot less pain in my joints. I love the diversity of exercises. It make it more fun having various routines and to work the body in different ways. Congratulations to all of You, and Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!”
— Ana Paula O.
“I love Kaisa's 'mobility moments', they're a great warm up to my workout.”
— Anita M.
“Awesome full body yoga series. Very energizing for spine.”
— Elisha F.

“I love the instructors' focus on being physically active as main motivation for working out. JUST MOVE has movement options for every level and every mood - no matter whether I feel like working up a serious sweat, working on improving technique, loosening up or just getting some movement in (mobility moments! movement snacks!), JUST MOVE has it all! I love the variety of instructors, styles, and original and creative workouts. While I primarily do the mobility, strength, and cardio workouts, I recently dared to venture out into some dance classes. As all JUST MOVE instructors, Kisha makes her classes accessible and inclusive for everyone :) I'm super happy to be part of this community :)”
— Nathalie S.

“My daughter and I love the Just Move programmes, Kaisa and all the instructors!! Keeping us strong and flexible. So many options to choose from. We are spreading the word down in New Zealand:) Thanks so much. Jane”
— Jane S.
“Thank you for your story, which makes me forget it is hard, thank you for your excellent single side movement which is necessary when recovering from a hip injury. I've tried multiple workouts and this one worked to relieve my persistent hip.pain that prevented from moving Thank you”
— Joyce C.
“Loved it. Having a hard time moving these days. This is a nice easy way to get some movement into the day.”
— Maureen W.
“Love everything about this.”
— Liz B.
“I've been using these workouts to supplement my outdoor activities(skiing and mountain biking) and let me tell you...my balance, strength and capabilities have increased. Recently on the trail I went over my handlebars multiple times in one day; and I equate my lack of any injuries to the dynamic and relevant movements of Just Move and Kaisa's past programs. If you ask my friends they'll tell you every time I save myself from a close call I exclaim "It's Kaisa!" Kaisa's programming is global!!!!! These trainers are so well rounded and focused on movement. LOVE!”
— Kaylee C.
“Up until now, I've been doing the "start" level workouts... today I decided to kick it up a notch & tried the Endurance workout. Very tough, but still enjoyed it. Even though I mostly stayed at the initial level for each move, :-)”
— Tara P.
“Fun and motivating workouts. The a la carte set up works really well for me since I get bored easily and have a hard time sticking with long programs with only one kind of exercise and instructor. I love doing ballet one day, kickboxing the next and mobility always feels good.”
— Alison F.
“Good value for price, lots of options for variety of activities, levels of fitness, and duration. Program itself is great. Only complaint is ease of access. I do this with my children often but even on my own prefer to larger screen to be able to easily follow along. My combination of technologies means to access the videos in my workout area means buying an adapter for hooking my computer or phone up to the tv. It's doable, but means another added cost and the hassle of moving my computer and cords back and forth. It's not prohibitive, just not ideal. It would be great if the material was accessible through a downloadable app on my Roku device (which is not compatible for casting.)”
— Jessica S.

“I’m new to Kaisa Fit and I’ve mostly done the “Start” videos and a yoga video. So far, I love it. I absolutely love that if I don’t feel like working out, I can choose a 10 minute mobility video and leave it at that. But every time I’ve done that, I feel so good I end up adding another video to my practice that day. I love that Kaisa is HAES aligned and I feel her workouts are a safe space for someone recovering from orthorexia. I’m SO glad I took a chance and signed up for the year.”
— Wendy K.
“I love the beginner workouts for Just Move. It's been a long time since I exercised regularly, and Just Move is making it possible and fun. Kaisa is very affirming and inclusive. It's so hard to find a *true* beginner workout. I've been looking a long time for something just like this. I'm hooked!”
— Lizzie M.
“I am in love with the Just Move, it has various exercises for all levels, with different duration and everything from strength based to yoga and dance moves. I forgot how much fun moving can be!”
— Hend A.
“The library is great! It's easy to navigate, full of different workouts and the workouts I've done feel good. It's nice to see such a diverse group of trainers on here - thank you for all your work!”
— Megan M.
“Hi! I want to start saying that I love Kaisa and the team and I find them highly motivational but I was hoping for a little bit of an extra challenge. I would love if more advanced classes could be added weekly. I generally add a few repetitions to the workout to get a full workout that can suit me better or I combine a couple of the shorter classes together but it would be good to see some longer workouts as well (45 minutes would be ideal for me). Thanks for the great work and the energy you put in every class!!”
— Cecilia B.
“I have been away from moving for far longer than I would ever wish. Kaisa's classes are just amazing - she does such a good job reminding us how to listen to our bodies and breathe through the movement. I already feel better!”
— Heidi B.
“I love it! Makes moving everyday fun and different, I look forward to different workouts daily that I can do with minimal equipment from my home! Love the variety of workouts and trainers.”
— Nicole M.
“¡Es excelente! explicaciones muy claras de ejercicios muy útiles para sedentarios que queremos iniciar un estilo de vida más activo.”
— Benjamín T.
“WOOOO! Getting back to movement after a 2 year break-even just one week in my mobility is improved and I’m not making quite as many old-lady noises when I get up off the floor...Thank you Kaisa!!!”
— Christina S.
“Start is a great place to learn the basics and get moving! Especially if you have never exercised or it’s been awhile. I first saw KaisaFit on a Facebook ad and thought, I want to move like that! I’m not there yet but I’m feeling stronger and more confident that I can get there! That’s why I decided to join for the year so I can have access to all the workouts on KaisaFit! 1 year to commit to myself moving more and feeling my best!”
— Julia E.
“I cannot express how much I LOOOOVE Kaisa and her team of talented and amazing instructors/trainers. My fave gal is Kaisa not only is she motivating, energetic, and knowledgable, she is entertaining. She brings her positive and quirky energy to each workout! Thanks Kaisa and team for the stellar workouts!”
— Brittney C L.
“I am loving this new platform! As someone who has had a fairly inconsistent year for movement, it has been so nice being able to get back into it with accessible classes. I love the idea of working out just to get your body moving as opposed to working out for aesthetics or whatever. I came from a place of working out with “advanced” level programs for years to scaling back down to beginner/intermediate in 2021 and it feels SO good. It’s so freeing to move just for the sheer enjoyment of it. Thanks for bringing us all of these amazing instructors and for helping change the ingrained ideas about workouts/fitness/diet culture.”
— Abby B.

“Finally! A subscription that uses both my mind and body. I struggle to work out consistently and often find any excuse to skip it. This subscription has removed all my issues. I love being able to sort quickly for my fitness level, time available, and type of workout. Keeps everything interesting and from becoming monotonous. Having options that range from easy stretching, more involved yoga, to body weight and actual weights is great. Not just one style or trainer makes me feel like I have my own personal team helping me get fit. Thank you KaisaFit and Just Move!”
— Leatha P.
“I love your platform. I'm 52 years old and I am moderately active, but I tend to get bored with my workout routine. You have changed that for me. I have been following and using your programs for a few years. Having different workouts that are only 30 minutes in length is very motivating. It also helps that there is a variety of instructors and fitness levels. Thank you for creating a platform for all people.”
— Jennifer J.
“Loving Just Move so far. Great variety, lots of fun! I enjoy having the weekly program selection too so I don't have to think. I was hestitating to buy a subscription but I'm glad I did because this awesome library is helping me spring out of bed in the mornings!”
— Virginia G.
“Love the variety of workouts! I like how the instructors explain the movements and they also seem to know when I need to be told to breath🤣”
— Michelle I.
“Thank you so much for putting together so many fun and innovative new sessions!!! I have had such a blast this week exploring mobility, cardio and yoga flows. Kaisa I love your stuff and am a huge fan, and I am also really enjoying getting to know new instructors through JUST MOVE!! It has inspired me to stay connected to movement at exactly the time that my practice needed something to keep me engaged! Great work Y'all!!”
— Stacy T.

“Recovering from a surgery and seeing an opportunity to get back to basics, I joined the Just Move community to take things one step at a time and get back to my fitness routine slowly. Using the Start Challenge and Start Workouts, I’ve discovered it’s important to go back and revisit form every once in a while! Going slowly is a heck of a workout and I cleaned up some of my postures and form. Thanks Kaisa and Team :)”
— Kerri M.
“I am really enjoying my subscription to Hust Move. It is really great to have a library of different workouts to choose from.. it makes me excited to see what I will choose each day..the coaches are all so supportive and personable. I love the ethos of just move. Its teaching me to slowly look at exercise as more than just wanting to burn calories and accept my body the way it is now....not easy. For me, I would like to see more advanced workouts of all types. After a week of workouts that is the level I feel I am at. Also I like the focus on full body workouts (apart from the separate mobility, yoga etc). I am less likely to do workouts specific to core etc I feel.very lucky to be part of this community. I think it's really great the way you communicate with the community and take on board suggestions. Thank you and I look forward to what is to come. Sandra”
— Sandra H.
“I have had a terrific time watching all the new sessions in the evening and then adding them to my favourites to try out the next day. I have a great list of favourites and depending on my mood select the type of session I can do. I have been having great fun in the comfort of my own home doing different types of classes.”
— Tina D.

“I love the filter feature, so I can focus on the workouts my body really needs at that moment. I’m usually somewhere between Intermediate and Advanced levels, so this allows me to challenge myself when I want to, or I can take it easy after an injury or a rough day. Having so many options in the type of workouts I can choose is so freeing, and exciting! I can’t wait to see where it all goes from here!”
— Candice P.
“loving it!”
— janine c.
“I’ve been following Kaisa for a while, and as soon as she announced Just Move, I knew I wanted to join. I’ve enjoyed all the classes I’ve taken so far, and I’ve even been able to branch out and take classes that I’ve never tried (like barre and boxing). I fell into a bit of a rut during the pandemic and this was the boost I needed to get moving again. The instructors are great, the content is great, and I’m so glad I get to be a part of the beginning of Just Move!”
— Lauren C.
“I love the variety in the programs! A lot of great stuff from top notch instructors! Thank you!”
— Eleni S.
“Love the variety of workouts! I also love that they are the perfect length and the workouts themselves are designed around safety and function!”
— Nicole J.
“Fantastic!! I love the variety in this library. (Variety in styles and challenge level.) You can follow the daily workout or choose your own. Just Move is all about wellbeing and looking after your mind and body. It’s perfect. The challenging workouts will leave you feeling accomplished for the work you’ve done without feeling depleted and the beginner workouts will make your joints feel wonderful. If you’ve never exercised before it’s an excellent way to start because there’s ‘start’ workouts that will gently guide you along.”
