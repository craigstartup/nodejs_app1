Coaching Wk 6 - Brand Focus Group

In our sixth session, I took on the responsibility of creating a somewhat rustic keynote presentation in the absence of my wonderful colleague, Jen, who had to attend to a family emergency. This week, we delved into the invaluable process of feedback through client surveys and establishment of a focus group, an essential strategy to foster growth and understanding in personal branding.

Surveying clients is an immensely powerful tool. It provides anonymous, candid feedback, and crucial data to fine-tune our approach in business. While discussing the art and importance of soliciting feedback from clients and peers, I emphasized the emotional challenges it poses due to our intrinsic fear of rejection. Nonetheless, understanding what we are doing right—and wrong—can significantly influence our growth and direction.

Further, I introduced the concept of a focus group, which I believe is akin to a face-to-face survey. This method involves creating a safe space where a small, select group of individuals can provide focused feedback on one’s brand and future steps. I shared a personal anecdote from 2006, where a network of supportive women provided me insights that were pivotal as I ventured from portrait photography into the international stage.

For those looking to assemble their own focus groups, I suggested hosting an intimate, in-person session—ideally within one’s own brand space. This setup not only fosters genuine connection and truth but also imbues the space with the essence of one's brand. I theorized about a perfect evening where selected participants, preferably close associates or clients who understand your business, could be invited for a structured yet cozy discussion over wine and cheese, offering their insights in exchange for a delightful experience.

I also touched on my personal journey, recounting times when I stood at the crossroads of my career. These were moments filled with uncertainty, yet ripe with potential for transformation. I used personal stories to underline the value of feedback. For instance, the unexpected and affirming feedback from a respected fellow photographer early in my career gave me a newfound realization of my potential. It was a seed sown early that made me ponder the true reach and impact of my work.

As we navigate through our professional lives, the clarity about what we truly want often becomes obscured. I stressed the importance of aligning one’s actions with their deepest desires and intentions. The format of a focus group inherently encourages this alignment by demanding clarity and preparation from the participants, as they must articulate precisely what they seek to understand or achieve from the session.

To bring theoretical concepts into practical application, I proposed employing tools such as online platforms or adapted questionnaires that allow participants to express their perceptions, which can then be turned into actionable insights. This method not only tailors the feedback to be constructive but also ensures that it aligns perfectly with the targeted goals of the focus group.

In sum, the journey of personal branding is as much about introspection and understanding oneself through the eyes of others as it is about outward expression and communication. By building a close-knit community of feedback, be it through surveys or focus groups, we allow our personal brands to resonate more deeply and authentically with our intended audiences.
