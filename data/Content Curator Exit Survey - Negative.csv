"Sue is always very inspiring so it is a big chance to hear from her in a new course. Then the fact that it was about content curating, the subject that is very challenging and tough to tackle these days was the main reason I signed up. To get me started, to encourage me to think differently about all the social media and online platforms and to brave in making new contents in a job I love.","It did and did not. I was not the same as I thought at first, and doing talks and podcasts was not of my interest or in my dreams, so there has been a lot of times I have second thought to stop and ask for refund but still I am always fascinated to Sue and all the offers so I am staying and re listening to them too.",,"more focus on the overall content curating idea, the challenges, having discipline and our approach to the rather uncomfortable task.","It is mostly about speakers to me. Talk your ideas, speak to your audience. I know these are simple rather than being creative topics but just to give you an idea."
"I have been a creative solopreneur for over 16 years, and I always work with clients providing service (trade money for my time). I have a lot of work, but I always get burned out or feel exhausted. I needed ideas to make my knowledge and skills into new content that would make me enough money, but I didn’t have to feel almost dead now and then and constantly stressed. I want to use my time also to create art, but as we know, we need other methods to make an income.",It has been a good and helpful course but I don’t have a clear idea yet how I can take action in reality.,,"I’m not sure. Maybe there is not much real interaction. But I’ve enjoyed the content on my own time. I feel energized when I start the week and I watch the new episode. It makes me feel that I might figure something out, to get out of the rat race, but at the same time the path doesn’t feel very clear. It probably should but it doesn’t . I just don’t know yet what kind of content would truly allow new income and how I should do it (also English is not my first language and I should do it in English). But this course makes me realize it’s possible and I might find a way.","Creative content creator - for me it’s about creating, not curating"

The word ""curator"" fits well for the course. Or, maybe it's just the description or subtitle and not the name that needs tweaked. Either way, it has still been very helpful.

I have done many of Sue’s courses in the past and she is very motivating.

I thought it would help me expand and pivot my existing book brand to something bigger.

I think that needs expanding. It's a meaty course and there's a lot of work in it as I would expect from Sue. I think branding like this takes time, it evolves in people and doesn't necessarily pop into their heads when they are going through a workbook. It percolates and comes to you at random times :) In a way it's a lot to go over in 6 weeks.","I like Content Curator, it does what it says on the tin."

"I have followed Sue since the early days on Creative Live and have watched her grow.  I am currently lost.

My starting point might be a little further back.,Creative Compass
"I thought I would learn how to conceptualize, contextualize and personalize content for marketing my business",sort of. In some ways it took me way beyond what I thought I'd be learning. In others it was very much about building out a new leg of my business and seems focused on very specific avenues for revenue with heavy emphasis on speaking so it seems a little out of the range I thought we'd be in. It's also moving very fast and is less directly involved with Sue than I expected. The coaching calls are not personal to our work really so that's not what I was expecting.,,I think the first invitation I got on instagram gave me a different impression about what the class was going to be so maybe check the consistency of the messaging? It would be great if we could engage a little more with our projects and questions. Grouping questions through the producer on set is a bit ... underwhelming for all of us.

"Firstly, I love Sue Bryce and came into the Portrait System only relatively recently and often wonder what my trajectory would be like if I had of been one of the early ones so the idea of getting in at the start of Content Creator was super appealing. Secondly I thought I really wanted to look at creating an online platform for beginner photographers, expanding my boutique photography workshops and somehow monetising my beginner photography education.","To be honest, the biggest thing that Content Curator has helped me with is making me realising that the reason I signed up for Content Curator is not something I thought I wanted to purse and clarifying that what I want to do is to keep on taking photographs and mastering my craft and what I want to monetise is my poetry work!",,"There is a part of me that wants to say that it really needs to be highlighted that Content Curator is not for someone who is at the beginning of their journey. I have realised that by focusing on what I want to do that I still need to really build up my content (not content to sell but content to increase followers, not sure of wording), know how and direction. But then I would not have realised that I needed to asses my direction and the honesty of what made my eyes light up without the first couple of weeks content so perhaps it is good for beginners in that it gives you a sense of direction and purpose and you can there is stuff for your down the track. I am still devouring the videos and have watched week 1 and 2 at least 3 times each and I suspect content Curator is for me possibly down the track so super handy and helpful. What it has done is really made me focus on what I want to do and really be honest with what I don't want to do.  

To be honest I am not a fan of Skool and possibly in the minority there but don't find it very user friendly and gave up using that. Love or loathe FB groups they have nailed the forum process in terms of being user-friendly, being able to look at all contributions etc and tne most efficient group forums. As I said I am possibly in the minority there but I am a fan of social media due to it being a free tool that has helped my business inordinately and really didn't warm to skool at all as found it pretty clunky in comparison. 

Videos are awesome. Lives are great. Content is great.","I am not entirely sure if Content Curation is the best name for this course but you guys are the bloody experts and have nailed everything else you have done so sure that it is pretty spot on and it might be more that I am possibly not at the right spot to gain full advantage of it but I am certainly going to access in future and it has given me a great deal of clarity about the fact that I was not actually heading in the direction I though I was heading. So I am not sure if the course sums it up or I thought I was enrolling in something more extensive for all types of content. So in a long round about way, I am not sure if Content Curator is the best even though Sue is obviously the master at Content Curation but not sure if it sums up this course."
"I thought it would help expand my photography business, give insights as to how to retrieve more clients and dabble more into curating content for brands/commercial work.",Yes and no. I think there’s value to what is being talked about. Clarity and the roadmaps certainly are key. No in the sense that it is very broad and I thought there would be more specific or one on one for seeking answers (perhaps another educator) to my specific situation.,,"I think should I want to further explore, podcasts, film, speaker or educator paths I will refer to this information. I definitely see myself becoming a speaker in the future however at this time I’m more interested in evolving my photography business. Shooting boudoir clients and doing commercial work.",I think the name you have is quite clever and content creator is overused. Content Curator on the other hand let you know you will create content but more importantly you will be selective and intentional with what you put out and why. Focusing on who you’re marketing to and what they can get out of it while simultaneously including yourself in an effective way (much like how Sue rolls). Off the top of my head I keep thinking what I’m getting here is a peek behind the curtain “How It’s Made” but I think Content Curator is more on brand and eloquent.
