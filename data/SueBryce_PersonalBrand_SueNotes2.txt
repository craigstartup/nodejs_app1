Solopreneurs: Everybody talks about brand identity, but what is brand identity when you’re a personal brand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We talk about brand being the face value of your business; this first impression is your brand perception.                                                                                                                                                                                                   But for a personal brand, that means it’s self-perception. If you want to elevate your brand value, elevate your self-value and become the person in the brand!                                                                                                                                                                                                   I don’t need to empower your brand I am here to empower you.                                                                                                 

Solopreneurs: Everyone discusses brand identity, but what does it mean when you’re a personal brand? Typically, brand identity is seen as the face value, the first impression that shapes brand perception. For a personal brand, this translates to self-perception. To increase your brand value, elevate your self-value and truly embody your brand.
