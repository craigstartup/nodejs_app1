Coaching Week 3 - Brand and Product

[00:00:01] Sue Bryce | Happyclappers. Hi, everyone. How you doing out there? We're at week 3. Now we start to get into some serious action, but this is one of my favorite weeks.

[00:00:12] Sue Bryce | This is one of my favorite weeks because now we get to talk about the product that you are about to sell. We're gonna talk about the product you're developing. We're gonna talk about the product that you have. We're gonna talk about the product that makes you money. And before we talk about selling it and marketing it, we have to talk about being in alignment with it, and what does alignment mean.

[00:00:34] Sue Bryce | Okay. This is the most important part about connecting you to this incredible product that you have now created or how do we make it more valuable, and how do we make ourselves more valuable. But before we go into that, I just wanna ask, are there any questions about last week that you would like to ask? Is there any questions that anybody has? Now this slide, I just want you to have a look at this because we talked about blocks, we talked about what's stopping you from moving forward, we talked about, I can't, because we talked about, you know, a stuck mindset, We talked about the stupid beliefs we have, but you know what?

[00:01:15] Sue Bryce | The bottom line, the core of all of that, comes down to these 3 things. If you say I can't do that, I have no money, If you say I can't do that, I have no support. And if you say I can't do that, I have no time. That is different from saying I could do this if I have a better commercial space. I could do this if I had better equipment.

[00:01:42] Sue Bryce | I could do this if the economy was better. I could do this if I had, an assistant. Those things are definitely very important and they're not stopping you from moving on, they you you've just identified you need something to take the next step. That's what it is. But these 3, these 3 stay, they stay set as a belief system.

[00:02:05] Sue Bryce | They are so intrinsically tied to a core belief about you, you might not even notice that you believe 1 or all three of these things. But if you're saying I don't have time, and I don't have support to do what I want, and I don't have money for me, then what you're saying is for me, Because if you say I don't have an assistant, you need help. If you say I need better equipment, you need to upgrade your equipment. But those three things are yours, and only yours, And if you believe those 3 things, they're going to stop you from moving forward because you're giving yourself away to others. This particularly happens to women who start businesses.

[00:03:02] Sue Bryce | Men are much better at compart mentalizing. However, I've coached many men that support their wife and children financially, and that have struggled to cross into self employment. Because of the responsibility they have, knowing a salary or a wage will get that number, but the unknown of starting a business when they have that responsibility weighs on them. So it's a different type of belief, but the truth is, is no money, no support, no time is your personal belief about you. I want you to read this slide.

[00:03:41] Sue Bryce | I want you're gonna get it anyway, but I want you to, like, tattoo it onto your forehead, because if you do for others, if you do for others, you need boundaries, because people will just expect you, they will just expect you to be there doing for them. That's who you are. Yes, mothers fall into this so easily, but all women do, I don't have children, and I still feel as a woman that I have to be there for everybody else because I was raised that way, I'm conditioned that way. Now think of it like this. If I'm always there for everybody else, and everybody is expecting me to do for them all the time, who will value my solitude?

[00:04:32] Sue Bryce | Name a family member that you have that values your solitude. Your solitude has no value to anybody else but you, and that's why you won't give it to yourself. You need to feel valued by other people constantly. That's not value. That's validation that you're a good enough person.

[00:04:57] Sue Bryce | Think about it. You 100% cannot take time for yourself when no one that needs you values that time for yourself, they will make you feel guilty, they will make you feel bad because you aren't doing what you normally do over here for all of them. It's that simple. So if you do for others, you need boundaries. Or they just expect you to be there, but this is the bit that they want you to tattoo on you.

[00:05:33] Sue Bryce | Your solitude has no value to them. It has no value to anybody but you, and you have to fight for it. Now, if you had children, let's say children because they are the biggest like suckers of our energy and our need, and we wanna be super parents, because we have all this guilt and shame. And the thing is, if you go and start a business and you're giving 80% of your time to your kids, How would it be different if you went and got a job? Cause if you went and got a job for 8 or 10 hours a day, your children would not have a choice.

[00:06:18] Sue Bryce | They leave, they go into a job. Dad leaves, he does a job, he comes home, he is not here for 10 hours. That's just the way it is. They know that. That's a boundary, but when you become self employed and you go to build a business and you're working from home, nobody will value your solitude, nobody will value your time, unless you take it and say, I'll be gone for 4 hours on Tuesday.

[00:06:45] Sue Bryce | I will not be contacted for what do you guys need, make sure because I'm going to be out taking that time to build your business and build yourself. It's that simple. And I need you to fight for that solitude, or you'll never get it. Now, maybe you don't think you're valuable yet because you're just building the business, So you go to build the business and 3, 4 hours doesn't get you much work, does it? You've got to go back to doing what you maybe don't want to do.

[00:07:13] Sue Bryce | And then all of a sudden, your priorities are like, I really want to create this. But I'm going to have to shift my time, and that means the most valuable product that you have right now is what time, my friends. So when you tell me you can't charge for your time, your family are the ones that suffer when you aren't charging their time away from them, because they aren't getting the reward, and they're not getting you, and you're not valuing your time, so you're being disrespected by your client and your children. It's about you can be a mother and a business owner. You can be a father supporting your children and build a business.

[00:08:01] Sue Bryce | You can do that because you can make more money in a business than you do working for the man. It's just that simple, but it is this belief that we get stuck in. And right now, that makes time, your most important product. And right now, we're talking about your products, so we're gonna do this thing. Today, I'm gonna get a table, and you're gonna put one product at a time.

[00:08:27] Sue Bryce | I don't know how many products you have. But you're gonna put the most important product on the table, and we're all gonna look at it. We're gonna ask questions about it. And every question I ask about this product will take you closer and closer and closer to being connected to it and selling it. You ready?

[00:08:48] Sue Bryce | Okay. What's the product you're putting on the table? What product are you putting on the table? Write it down. What's your product?

[00:08:57] Sue Bryce | You've got to break it down for me, so put it at the top of the page, whatever your product is, This is what you sell. This is your main product first. Alright. So what is your product? So you've got your product, right?

[00:09:20] Sue Bryce | Now. Do you feel like your true identity is in this brand? Yes, or no. I don't wanna maybe, I don't wanna, I'm getting there. Do you believe that your true identity, we've walked the $1,000,000 path, we've walked the multiverse, We know what we want.

[00:09:46] Sue Bryce | We're forming a clear vision. Now, when you look at your brand, do you feel connected to it? Do you feel like your product and service is good enough to sell right now? Yes or no? Don't lie.

[00:10:05] Sue Bryce | If you truly want to say yes, but your heart is saying, it's just not, they don't. It's okay. It's gonna show you what it is. I'm gonna show you what it is, but you have to tell the truth. You can write yes or no in the chat, please, because everyone sitting here cannot yes or no to me, and I can see that, but you guys can write yes or no in the chat, because if you don't believe that this product is good enough, you need to start there.

[00:10:31] Sue Bryce | And if you don't believe that your brand holds your true identity and the true path, then you have to start there. Now, for 15 years of coaching businesses, that one question I get constantly, it's not selling. It's not selling. I've got this product, but it's not selling. It's not selling.

[00:10:50] Sue Bryce | And I always say if it's not selling, it's not connected to you, and it's not connected to the people out there, which means because it's not connected to you, you're not connecting it to the people out there. This is the rule. No value means no alignment. If you're in alignment, you have value if you have alignment, you have value. So when you can't sell it, it's not connected, and it's not connecting to the people, right?

[00:11:16] Sue Bryce | So this is a fact. You can't sell something you don't love. You just can't. If you can sell something you love, you will start selling. This is my definition of alignment.

[00:11:32] Sue Bryce | Alignment is when your actions, your values, and your purpose are all moving in the same direction, right? It's like a feeling connected to what you're creating and selling because it's a true expression of who you are. It's about being in harmony with your work, So your energy, your vision, and so everything you do feels authentic and empowered. That's when you will find your value. That's when you speak about anything, it just connects.

[00:12:08] Sue Bryce | I connected that 20 years ago, 25 years ago. I worked out how to speak in alignment to myself, to other people. I learned that if I simply explained to people why it was so incredible, that they would be sitting there listening to me with the same energy, the same excitement, the same feeling that I embody as the provider of this service and this product. I believe in it. When I wrote this workshop, I put a workshop out there.

[00:12:42] Sue Bryce | I hope people connect with it, but you haven't really felt the content yet. It's not until I start connecting with you and start teaching you that I watch your light bulbs go up, I watch you start to change your path, your business, your income, and all of a sudden, I know you're getting into a and you're getting into alignment because I'm in alignment. I don't teach something that I'm not in alignment with. I don't create something I'm not in alignment with because I burned out so many times in all of my businesses, and every time I burn out, it shows up in my income immediately. It's like, I'll come to my studio, and there'll be no bookings for 3 months.

[00:13:27] Sue Bryce | Just gone. I get my energy right again, I reconnect, I restore, I replenish, I reconnect to my goals, I reconnect to my product, my service, my experience, and when I reconnect to all of that, suddenly the phone starts ringing again. It's just constantly attracting, so it's like, it's always my energy. So what is product alignment? Alright?

[00:13:52] Sue Bryce | How do you feel so good about this product that you're making? Now, these are the 8 products that you can create that make income into your business. And out of those 8 products, you know, your product, this one here, fits into one of them. Which one? Which one does it fit into?

[00:14:14] Sue Bryce | Is it a digital service? Is it a physical service? Is it a digital product? Is it a physical product? Is it a podcast?

[00:14:22] Sue Bryce | Are you creating speaker content? Are you creating workshops and retreats or are you building a community and an audience because you can monetize that as well? So the product that you've the first product, you're gonna do one product at a time, you're now defining what that product is, and now you're gonna put that product right here, and you're gonna look at it, and I need you to answer these questions. What is it? Imagine I've never seen you or your business before.

[00:14:54] Sue Bryce | What is it? Can you describe it simply? If you can't describe it simply, you don't know it well enough. Describe your product for me. Describe it in 14 word sentence.

[00:15:06] Sue Bryce | Did you know 14 to 17 words is the ultimate bite size sentence for online. Everybody reads it because it's short, it's concise, and it gets to the point. So can you describe your product in 14 to 17 words? And if not, could you do it in two sentences? And if you can't describe it with value in two sentences, you need to hit chat TPT and come up with millions of different ways to say what you need to say as clearly and concisely as you can.

[00:15:39] Sue Bryce | Is it a digital product, physical product? Is it a service? Is it a, digital service or a physical service? Now, maybe it's a physical service and a physical product. Maybe it's a physical service and a digital product.

[00:15:53] Sue Bryce | Maybe it's a digital service and a digital product. It doesn't matter, you're just looking at this one product. What does it do? What is it? Can I describe it?

[00:16:03] Sue Bryce | And yes, these 4 are the favorite that it comes down to, because the act of doing this, like a physical service, would involve you going to do it, and the act of creating a digital service would be setting up systems. So what we're gonna do is these are all about systems and how we're going to sell these products, because a digital product is sold very different than a physical service. Alright? So once you've identified, okay, I have these 2 things. I have a physical service.

[00:16:33] Sue Bryce | I photograph people. And then I sell digital products, I sell a digital package, so those 2 things are what I'm focused on, and I need to create sales systems around both those products, right? Cause they're all different sales systems. That's what's important. So what is the system and the process around your product?

[00:16:56] Sue Bryce | How do people hear about it? How do they call you, email you, do you have a consultation? Do you have a pre call to educate them and connect with them? Do you, have your VIP clients go on a waiting list where they have to apply to be with you? Like, what is the onboarding process of selling this product, this specific product?

[00:17:21] Sue Bryce | And you need to be able to tell me exactly what it does, but the one thing you need to focus on now is what is the experience that the client has in that onboarding process? That's the first touch of experience with you. That's one of your biggest touch points after meeting you, hearing your pitch, maybe even getting to a point where they're reaching out to you, that experience will stop 1000 and tens of 1000 of dollars to come to you if you have not created an experience. For instance, I don't email clients. I don't want to.

[00:18:01] Sue Bryce | I hate email, but you give me a phone, and you give me that client's phone number, and if they can't come in for a consultation, I will call them and I will I will 100% get that client on the phone. I can't do that on email. And I don't care who you think you are. It works better on the phone, but maybe that's just for me. Because there are email systems, like Nikki created templates so you know what to say to your clients, but ultimately, you're onboarding people so that they can take the next step, which is paying you So a physical product, you manufacture, you make it, you sell it in person, or you ship it and deliver it.

[00:18:46] Sue Bryce | That comes with an online experience. It also comes with an in person experience. So both of those things, what is it? What makes your experience good? Interesting fun?

[00:19:00] Sue Bryce | What makes it engaging? What makes people connect to you? And what makes them say yes because if you haven't created that onboarding, then you truly cannot. So I'm making 3, 6 for the physical service. Is it through LinkedIn.

[00:19:18] Sue Bryce | Oh, sorry. That's not a question. I'm just checking the chat, but Melissa's gonna check the chat. Alright. If you can have a physical service, so an in person experience, you either have to have a place where people can come to you, or you have to be able to go on location to do this, or you have to go to them.

[00:19:37] Sue Bryce | That's a physical service, hands on, money for time, touching people. What's the experience for that? Have you created an onboarding experience for your clients that would get to a VIP waiting list? Cause you have so many clients, have you made it special? Do you not take time to talk to these clients right from that beginning?

[00:19:57] Sue Bryce | Because right then, that's when it's the most important time. Alright. So if you have a digital product, It's downloadable. Alright? That's make money while you sleep.

[00:20:15] Sue Bryce | So while I'm sleeping comfortably in my bed, making money with a smile on my face, I'll wake up to somebody that purchased my product at 1 am, because they're in, Australia. They purchased the product at 1 am my time. They put their email address in wrong when they paid because 99.9 percent of the help desk I pay for is I can't log in. And 99.9 percent of the time, you spelled your email wrong when you first did your account, and because you don't know your incorrect spelling, you can't log in. Now, I don't wake up till 8 AM.

[00:21:02] Sue Bryce | I don't get to work until 8 or 9 because I have a daily ritual that's way more important, And by the time I get on my social media, she's on Facebook, slang me. She's on Instagram, slaying me. Who do you think you are? You're a rip up. I've got nothing.

[00:21:21] Sue Bryce | So if you do not have a system set up around the sale of this product, that's what happens to you, and it needs to be like a 24 hour help desk service if you're selling international products and lots of them online, because they need to be able to solve those problems at 1 o'clock in the morning. Now the rule of thumb in any business is when somebody gives you money, they have all the power until the delivery of the product. If you took my money and you took too much time to deliver this product, you didn't even care about me, you didn't follow through, you never once told me it was gonna be late, I am going to slay you, you have my money, and I have nothing Right? We've all been there. And it's horrible, but that's what you gotta do.

[00:22:18] Sue Bryce | So if there's no system, there's no experience. And their only experience is your system is shit, and I feel ripped off. And I'm going to take this online. That's how it happens. And it's one of the hardest things to do, but you must create a system, a process, and an experience around each product.

[00:22:42] Sue Bryce | Why is it special? Why would I spend $3000 on it or $10,000 or $40,000 on it? Like, if you don't make that process important for me, I won't feel important, I certainly won't act important. To me, the consultation is everything. So a guy reached out to me on Instagram, recently, month ago, he's got 2 and a half million followers.

[00:23:06] Sue Bryce | He has a podcast, and he says, I keep seeing your videos pop up on Instagram, I love what you do. I'm a big networker. I'm into people who are making ways, people who are taking steps. I do an onboarding networking call. It's 15 minutes.

[00:23:26] Sue Bryce | I book them on Fridays. Here's a link to my booking page if you're interested in connecting and seeing how we can move forward together. Now, I think 2 things. He's got a huge audience. He's got a podcast.

[00:23:38] Sue Bryce | Of course, I'm going to talk to this guy. I don't know anything about him. I look at him. Online. He looks good.

[00:23:44] Sue Bryce | I booked the 15 minute call in 15 minutes. He's like, this is who I am. This is what I do. Tell me about you. And then for like, 9 minutes, I just told him all about me, and he was like, this is great.

[00:23:56] Sue Bryce | I've got a couple opportunities for podcasts, and he sent them to me, and it was great. And I was like, done. And then the call was over, and I walked away, and I thought, that's what I've been doing with consultations for 35 years. I have a potential client that would call me and want a photo shoot, I give them a 15 minute phone call. It changes everything about their

[00:24:15] Sue Bryce | ideas, their connection, me, I connect with them, I onboard them, and I add a 100% booking rate, and that

[00:24:15] Sue Bryce | tells me that that system works. And it works for everybody, not just for people, like, I prefer email. If you prefer email, you're hiding, and people won't read your email, nobody reads an email. Will they watch a video if you make it fun, but probably not? But will they listen to you?

[00:24:42] Sue Bryce | Yes. And remember the golden rule when you're connecting with somebody, either on phone or in person, they only remember what comes out of their mouth. They only remember what comes out of their mouth. So if I say my packages are 400 to 4000, if she or he does not repeat that, that's not what they heard. Because if they don't repeat 4000, they heard 400, and then in their mind said, well, I'll just be spending 400.

[00:25:09] Sue Bryce | And that's why you can tell by the way they repeat it, because people who say things like 4000 Like, they've said it back to you, and it's like, well, only if you've really loved them that much, and I'll let you decide that. They are 100% gonna spend $4000, because they just repeated it to me. They just set it back, and I know that when they leave, they left with one number in

[00:25:38] Sue Bryce | their mind, and it was $4000, because in their mind,

[00:25:38] Sue Bryce | they were so connected to me, the product, they could see the system around the product, that they're like, I'm gonna do this. And I'm like, I know. It's awesome. And then they're like, take my money, and then they walk you away going, oh my god, I'm gonna spend 4000. I don't want it, but I'd rather I just know it.

[00:26:02] Sue Bryce | And I could tell the difference by how they spoke back the price to me. Now when I said 400 to 4000, I let you choose, when you see the photographs, if they said in their mind, yeah, and sometimes they would say out loud, I'll be spending 400, just so you know. And I'd be like, again, don't make that decision until you see them, inevitably, they would be in that room, and only 1% would said, I told you I was gonna spend 400, and I'm here to pick one photograph, and I will spend $400, 1%. Everybody else doubled or tripled because they fell in love with the product and the experience, but so many of you do not have an experience or a system and process around that product. And if that product is your livelihood, why is this not the most valuable thing that you talk about, that you make.

[00:27:00] Sue Bryce | I had this incredible gift. I don't even know if it was a gift. Maybe it was. Yes, it was, because it comes from my dad, My dad was, he had a wonderment

[00:27:13] Sue Bryce | for this life. Everything my dad saw was like, Oh, look at that. Everything was deadly

[00:27:13] Sue Bryce | and to so cool, and he had this wide, I'd like I picked my parents up after they'd been in the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, because I was like, Dad, all the light touches. And, they'd flown down on a helicopter. They'd I'd gotten them as a gift to headline flow and back out of Bryce Canyon. And when I went to pick them up from that trip, I was at WPPO talking that day, they were sitting in this chair, and they were like this. And I just looked at my dad, and I was like, was that incredible?

[00:27:55] Sue Bryce | And he was like, I I can't I don't have words. And I just stood there and I had goosebumps all over my body. That's how I feel about my work. I was given something I was given a depth of passion, and passion is suffering. It's suffering, and I did suffer for my passion for a long time, but when I fall in love with something, I'm going to focus more on falling in love with it, because just talking about

[00:28:27] Sue Bryce | something in the energy I talk about things, books, and attracts thousands of people.

[00:28:27] Sue Bryce | It's just my secret is I'm in love. And I'm a 100% in love with what I make. And when I'm not, and I value no alignment. I'm not in alignment with it. And when I stop loving something, it's like my heart turns off, and then I start to wilt and it feels like dying, because if I'm not in love with that, I can't sell it.

[00:28:57] Sue Bryce | And if I can't sell that, I can't make money. When I sold the business and I had 3 years of resenting George for not starting a new business, which was really resenting myself, I realized that what I was most afraid of, the biggest thing that would make me shake and cry when I would explain it to people, was what if I don't find the love again? Like, I loved that for 35 years. I wanted nothing else. I was prepared to outwork anybody that said that they could outwork me.

[00:29:27] Sue Bryce | I was prepared to live and die on the sword of building my business. And I did, and I loved it, but I've 35 years, I touch my camera, and I just wilt. But when I teach business and money, I'm alive, so I was like, so it took me a while, 3 years, to work out who am I without that? And it was a lot of identity, but I felt very secure in my identity. I just started to, like, feel grief that I wasn't in love, with what I was doing.

[00:30:02] Sue Bryce | There was a moment in writing all of this content, and I it was, the 1st week of coaching. I finished the 1st week of coaching, and for the first time, I, after writing for months, I turned around and I said to the boys, I'm in love with this workshop. It's gonna get more legs. I'm so connected to it now. I'm I flow over it in the next 3 weeks of coaching already at already out of me.

[00:30:29] Sue Bryce | I can't get enough of it. I'm so into it. I'm so excited to watch people make more money and grow their personal brands. And when I felt that moment and I was just telling and I was telling George, I was standing, and I was like, I feel it, babe. Like, I feel it.

[00:30:44] Sue Bryce | You know, I could feel my whole body was just like, and it was, you know, and he was smiling at me, and I realized in that moment, that's the alignment. I need to be in alignment with each one of my products because I need to make them better, and how I do that was I love this workshop. Now teaching four hundred people and getting all your feedback will change the content. And you would just teach me more. And I'm like I like throw bait out, and then it's like burley.

[00:31:15] Sue Bryce | Okay. It's like we call it burley. What do you call it? Looks like vomit when you throw the bait. Chomp.

[00:31:23] Sue Bryce | That's it. We call it burly. And so you throw the burly out and all the fish come and then you catch them. And, like, that to me is that moment of just falling in love with it because now I know what my new path is, I know where I wanna go. I finished doing this workshop, and I've already got the next workshop planned, and I've already got the next coaching planned, and now I want to do more group coaching and one on one coaching just around certain areas, So to me, it was the moment of alignment, suddenly shifted everything.

[00:31:57] Sue Bryce | So if I could get you to fall in love with this product that we're talking about that's right in front of you, can you see your product sitting in front of you Do you love it? Then why aren't you telling everybody what's holding you back? Because all they ever had to do to reconnect to the money of my business was no matter how tired I got, no matter how burned out I got. When I came back and I was like, what I did one day is that I got this folio bought a book box book, made of all of my favorite photos. There were 60 portraits, just single girls, 60 photographs, and it was an album.

[00:32:41] Sue Bryce | I bought that album, never shared it with a studio, that was my album of my work, the top 60 photographs I've ever taken. I should show that book because but it wouldn't mean anything to you. It was more like I remembered that girl in that moment. I remembered mastering my flash that day. I remembered taking that portrait and thinking I've made it to the next level.

[00:33:06] Sue Bryce | I remembered taking that portrait, and she changed my 3 just by what she said to me that day. I met her 14 years later. She didn't remember me. Didn't matter. She changed my world, you know?

[00:33:21] Sue Bryce | And I looked through when I looked through this book, I'm like I did that. I made these.

[00:33:33] Sue Bryce | I did this. This came from me, and I get that creation

[00:33:33] Sue Bryce | energy, and it fills my soul. Now if I feel this and I walk into a networking event and you are worried about who's gonna talk to me, I don't look good, I wonder if I'm even good enough to be there, who's gonna be attracted to you. Get behind me, girlfriend. I'm taking it all. I'm walking in filled up.

[00:34:04] Sue Bryce | I run this over. That's what it is. I'm not lying to you. I have maintained that for 35 years. The more I push into it, the bigger my business gets.

[00:34:17] Sue Bryce | You know, when you meet somebody that's confident, they have clarity, they get to the point, they answer your question, solve your problems instantly. How could you not do business with this person? They're not pushing you, they're not selling you, they're they literally know stuff, and they're confident and clear, and the delivery of it And then they tell you that they could I could do something for you. They actually tell you what they can do for you. You don't have to sit there listening, you know, you have to actually just stop for one moment and tell them, 1, this is why I love my product.

[00:34:52] Sue Bryce | 2, this is what the product does. 3, this is how you're going to enjoy it. And then asking the questions, right, to connect them, that's the energy that I walk into.

[00:35:04] Melissa | Is there a way that you would recommend selling, digitally selling your physical products. Chelsea used to have a studio before studio space.

[00:35:13] Sue Bryce | I don't need an explanation. Okay. So how you digitally sell a physical product? So if it's a physical service and you sell a digital product, that's different. If you're saying, how do you visit digually how do you digitally sell a physical product?

[00:35:30] Sue Bryce | You put it on a store and you ship it to people when they buy it. Am I not is that right?

[00:35:36] Melissa | Yeah. I think she's asking how she can get more people to want to buy the product.

[00:35:40] Sue Bryce | Well, she has to tell people what the product is.

[00:35:45] Melissa | Yeah.

[00:35:46] Sue Bryce | So when you tell people what the product is and you talk about it with all that, you know, process, and there's a process around it, and it doesn't take long for people to fall in love with it. You can sell anything physical digitally. 100%. Okay. So have you created an experience for your clients, and have you created an experience around that product and around the booking of that product?

[00:36:11] Sue Bryce | And if not, how can we possibly get to selling next week and marketing the week after if you have not done that? Okay. So I did everything backwards. I went straight to money because you all told me you need it, and I was like, you can't get it when you push it away. Then I looked at your self value, and today I'm looking at your product, and I'm not feeling on this chat.

[00:36:35] Sue Bryce | Like, there's a lot of people that are in love with their product. Am I right? Why? Tell me why. Give me just stupid reasons.

[00:36:46] Sue Bryce | I want you to be ridiculous when I say things like that. Like talk to me like the three year old inside. It's not fair. My product's really good, and nobody's buying it. Like, that's how we talk to ourselves, and we don't say it out loud because we'll be judged, but the truth is you have a stupid belief around your product, but if there's no experience, no onboarding, no connection.

[00:37:11] Sue Bryce | How are you gonna market and sell this? Right? How are you gonna market it and sell it? So in marketing, they say sell everything, but the product. And I need you before we even get to marketing to be able to tell me everything that's valuable about this product and experience, and if you can't tell me what's valuable about this product and experience, you can't sell it.

[00:37:37] Sue Bryce | Where you go, I need at least 5 things on both lists. What is valuable about this product? What is valuable about my service? What is valuable about this product? What is valuable about my service?

[00:37:52] Sue Bryce | You might need to take time working on this, but trust me, if you can't say this clearly, and if you can't say it with value like it rolls off your tongue, you don't love that product. Now, if I sell sell everything but the product, do you come up blank? Cause that would be you. You are everything but the product. The experience you offer is everything but the product.

[00:38:22] Sue Bryce | How they feel about the product after they get it is not the product.

[00:38:26] Sue Bryce | That's all around the product, and everything I want you to just put that product on the table, maybe you

[00:38:26] Sue Bryce | could invite a friend around maybe you've got some networking friends that are business minded. They don't have to be in the same industry as you, and you can say, Hey, I'm gonna do a think tank. I'm buying cupcakes. I don't don't buy people sugar. I'm buying something, and we're going to, like, just talk, and I want you to tell me why you think my product is important.

[00:38:56] Sue Bryce | Also, you've been an ex client of mine, so you also have been through the process, maybe get an ex client that you trust, and have them all say, well, Sue, you did this, and that was mind blowing, and you did that, and that made sealed the deal for me. And when you told me about that, I was like, yes, because if you can't get to the value yourself, you need to get to the value from other people. I love my product, but I'm struggling to communicate why it's amazing. When I speak, I get too focused on what I'm saying, and I lose how I say it. This is for you, my friend.

[00:39:30] Sue Bryce | You can't tell me. So once you work out, you've got to actually feel it, and when you feel something, you don't have to practice it anymore because then you're speaking the truth, and it's called embodying value. Because that's what you need to do. Who believes they have to change the product to fall in love with it? Be honest, just write yes.

[00:39:50] Sue Bryce | Who believes they have to change the product for it to be valuable? Who believes they have to change themselves to be more valuable? Oh, it's valuable to me because it reminds me of my grandmother. How do you spend that? Oh, Diana, There are two things that make people cry when you are on stage and there is an audience of people.

[00:40:14] Sue Bryce | There are two things. It's when you talk about the unlived life of a parent, you watch the entire room, forty people, 4000 people, literally go inside themselves. Carl Young said there is no greater effect on a on a child than the unlived life of a parent. I put that quote on TikTok and got like a million views on it, just instantly, the unlived life of a parent, this idea that we want to be our full realized self, but if you had an unlived mom and dad, how can you become a fully lived person? You know, it's so it it's such an incredible that will make the room cry.

[00:41:03] Sue Bryce | And the next one is losing my my dad. If I talk about the loss of a parent, I I see at least two or 300 people instantly go into tears. So when I talked about that, and when I talked about that as a portrait photographer, what it meant to see generations of people, why the mother and daughter's shoot was so powerful, that was the most booked product that I sold because it was the one product I was most in alignment with in my personal self. Are you getting this? I have to change myself to feel valuable.

[00:41:40] Sue Bryce | Yes, you do. You have to change this. Nothing about this, and everything about this. I find that many of the words that I use to describe my product have been overused like transformation empowered. I need something more emotionally touching, then stop trying to be emotional and speak from your heart.

[00:41:58] Sue Bryce | If your heart does not say words like transformation and empowerment, why would it need to? It needs to speak authentically, not speak pretty words. Pretty words don't work. Authenticity out vibrates every other emotion, so

[00:42:14] Sue Bryce | you might as well be the truest version of yourself. I'm gonna paraphrase a few questions on here

[00:42:14] Sue Bryce | that have a lot of emphasis on how to

[00:42:23] Melissa | communicate their passion for their products?

[00:42:25] Sue Bryce | Yes.

[00:42:26] Melissa | Online.

[00:42:26] Sue Bryce | I think

[00:42:27] Melissa | that's really what people are trying to

[00:42:28] Sue Bryce | get to

[00:42:28] Sue Bryce | the bottom.

[00:42:28] Sue Bryce | We're getting there. It's a it's a long class, but we're getting there. I'm going to start tying in the marketing. So I I always look at it like this. What you don't realize is whatever I'm addressing, and whatever's coming next, which is selling and marketing, I'm moving towards it.

[00:42:43] Sue Bryce | Okay? So as you start to say, yeah, but I get that, but now I have to market that. Yes, that's coming, so just hold with me here because if I don't get you to change it back here, you won't be marketing anything, or you will be, but nobody will be listening. Alright. So remember this from day 1, what makes something valuable?

[00:43:04] Sue Bryce | Okay, what makes something valuable. At the end of the day, what makes it valuable is I value it. And now you understand why, when I fall in love with that product and service, when I truly fall in love with this, and I see people, I am 100% offering something I love more than anything in the world. I'm like, this is what I do. You know that whole, I'll have what she's having?

[00:43:32] Sue Bryce | Know how many people say that to me just because I'm lit up with what I do? Because 99% of the people I meet hate their jobs. And here I am this creative, I've got tattoos, I can wear do whatever I want, I can pierce my nose, I can dye my hair green, and my boss does not care because I'm a creative, and I'm an artist, and then they see me, and here I am just like, creating this incredible thing with my camera. And straight away, I could see people were just like, wow, you have a cool job. And I'm like, yep.

[00:44:07] Sue Bryce | And it's not the job that's cool, because you all know it's a hard job. You sweat, you crawl around on the floor, and you mostly do what other people want you to do, even when you don't want to do it, and the truth is, is it's not that glamorous, but I'm so in love with what I I was so in love with what I did, that it's so palpable to people. How could it not be? Alright. So I'm in love with generational portraits.

[00:44:36] Sue Bryce | My mom passed away, and now I've so much value. Yes. So you can say that. You can put, the experience yourself. Like imagine your generation on the wall, and then you speak about this.

[00:44:50] Sue Bryce | This was the person that I've immortalized for all time, you know, one of my all time favorite marketing lines is you as someone that I love, and I wanna capture you for all time, that to me was, like, anything generational or just hit all those heartstrings. And because it was authentic to me, it worked I need to buckle down. No, you don't. None of us need to buckle down or hustle. None of us need to change.

[00:45:15] Sue Bryce | None of us need to pull our worlds apart. None of us need to leave our spouses. Don't make me responsible for that. I said make it right before you leave. Leave in love.

[00:45:27] Sue Bryce | And nobody needs to blow up their world. You need to fall in love with this thing you make, man. Can I make that any clearer? Maybe I need to publish that in multiple languages. You can't sell it.

[00:45:44] Sue Bryce | You don't love it. Okay. From week 1, sorry, day 1. Actually, it might have been day 2 when I talked about value. No.

[00:46:00] Sue Bryce | That was segment 2 of the 2 days, these were all slides about value. So as you are doing your homework, because today, you're only just outlining this one product. You've got more than one product, I need you to go through those questions again with every one of those products when you get this, and this will be in your slideshow. And the reason I put 9 together is you already have these slides, but they are to remind you of what the value points are. And the good thing about that is there's so many good value points on there.

[00:46:32] Sue Bryce | Some of them are going to connect with you, and it's also going to highlight that you don't value yourself. So I need to buckle down and make myself talk about it openly. It's a me problem. I also feel I am stuck and maybe not in love with what I do anymore. Taking this workshop is a way to help me decide what this new path might be.

[00:46:53] Sue Bryce | Tina, can I tell you something? When you don't wanna do something anymore, there are two reasons. Okay? I've been here, I've been at this crossroad, and

[00:47:03] Sue Bryce | every time it was like going against my soul,

[00:47:09] Sue Bryce | wilting is the biggest way that is the secondary component, but at first, it doesn't feel right. All the sudden, it's like, this doesn't light me up, and this doesn't feel right. You're either burning out, and those who are burning out and not asking for enough money and enough boundaries around their own time, you're giving yourself a way to others, and nobody's gonna value your solitude period. So it's either burnout and you need to restore, you need to walk away, replenish, and set some boundaries. Or there's something you want, and it's the size of a mustard seed.

[00:47:50] Sue Bryce | And it's here, and you want to do this new thing, but you're still stuck in here because the belief has not exploded in you yet, that this is the new path you want to walk. So when I stood at that crossroad, I would always feel the the the dissonance, the resistance, and I would say, am I burning out, or is it time to create something knew. And often it was burnout at first, burnout

[00:48:24] Sue Bryce | burnout, and then it was

[00:48:24] Sue Bryce | it's time to create something new. That's when

[00:48:25] Sue Bryce | I started to get

[00:48:25] Sue Bryce | pulled apart because my ego said, but you are a photographer. And I said, but I've been a photographer for 20 years, and I've been employed for self employed for 10. Surely, I could just start teaching people this incredible business model, and my ego was like, no. Cause you're not a photographer anymore, and then the battle within me started, but it didn't change the fact that I had 2 choices at that crossroad. Burnout was one of them, and a new path, and you can walk a new path now as a personal brand without having to remove your identity and change your whole existence, because it feels like you're pulling

[00:49:08] Sue Bryce | yourself apart and you're not. I just wanna get back to what we used to have.

[00:49:08] Sue Bryce | Maybe transformation isn't explaining it well enough. If you used to have something I don't know if I'm talking to Brian or Lindsey, but if you used to have something and you lost it, go back to why you lost it, because you probably didn't love it. You probably weren't connected to it, and if you weren't, what will help you get connected to it moving forward? So I'm in love. I'm ready to take the next step, but old patterns trickle in, and I start to get anxious because the money isn't coming in fast enough, then you're too focused on money.

[00:49:45] Sue Bryce | And you're not focused on giving service, giving content. And when there's no value, there's no money, there's no value, there's no alignment to the content yet. That is the truth of it. You still need to feel the connection to you first before you can sell it. I'm not lucky.

[00:50:07] Sue Bryce | I'm aligned. I love that. That is the best Jane quote ever. Okay. Yes.

[00:50:12] Sue Bryce | Okay. Tina just responded. Thank you for that, sir. The seed story brought tears to my eyes, and that tells me that Tina has a mustard seed, she's not allowing to grow. And what happens is you start going against yourself, you're betraying yourself in that moment.

[00:50:29] Sue Bryce | So remember when I moved to Australia, I was leaving behind a studio that was earning a $1,000,000 a year, but I was only earning 50 to a $100,000, so it wasn't working for me. I went to Australia with a mustard seed to become a speaker and educator, to shear, to also shoot portraits, but I fell straight back into what I knew because I got scared, and I wasn't filling myself with value, and I wasn't doing the do, I was just talking the talk, and I wasn't walking the walk. And inevitably, money just evaporated from my life. $50,000 in savings just disappeared. I couldn't make income.

[00:51:08] Sue Bryce | I couldn't sell. And I had not got into alignment with what it is that I really want, what it is that I'm doing, and then get into the alignment with a product. The second I made those physical cards, and I told you for the first time I felt value even for the 20 years of career prior to that, that was the moment I created something that I was so in love with, and I just went, the value has been here the whole time. I just didn't see it. Right?

[00:51:43] Sue Bryce | Very, very, very important. So part of the selling, what is the most important thing that we have? Time? We just we just worked out people spend their entire lives, giving themselves away, giving their time away, and not valuing it. Well, if

[00:52:00] Sue Bryce | you're a physical service, a digital service, or a physical product, not a digital product, that's

[00:52:00] Sue Bryce | make money sleep, we need your time in order to get those things, and you don't value your time. It's really simple. People who

[00:52:14] Sue Bryce | value their time put up boundaries around when they can do things,

[00:52:23] Sue Bryce | And if you called me and said, Sue, could I please catch up with a 30

[00:52:28] Sue Bryce | minute phone call? And I said, yeah, I could probably do that, like, in 2 weeks, and Friday morning, I

[00:52:28] Sue Bryce | have a 10 o'clock. And I'm scheduling that, that's all I have, and you know that that's all I'm gonna give you, you take it because you're like, well, I know you're busy. Thank you so much. I have to put a boundary around that, or I have 36,000 people that wanna call, and what do I do? And you're doing it with your families, you're doing it with yourself, you're doing it with the business, and you're putting yourself last in all of them, and you're wondering why this is not working.

[00:53:05] Sue Bryce | So sometimes small changes will make the big difference. So what that means, we don't love it in that case. So what That means is we don't love it in that case. Sometimes small changes will make a big difference. Oh, Samir, take another run at that.

[00:53:26] Sue Bryce | I didn't quite get that. Alright. Any more questions out there? I'll just keep talking.

[00:53:30] Melissa | There's a few marketing questions. Do you think it's best too? It has

[00:53:33] Sue Bryce | to be marketing because I I love that people want to get to the marketing, but they don't know what to say. Yeah. So but ask me marketing questions.

[00:53:41] Melissa | They're asking if do you recommend testimonials? So so shows Oh, yeah. The posts or website.

[00:53:46] Sue Bryce | Hang on. Alright. This product that you've got on the table, answer me these questions. You need to be able to answer these questions. This is your marketing content.

[00:53:59] Sue Bryce | What does it do? So clearly and so simply, what does it do? What problem do you solve with that product? That product, the one we're talking about? What problem do you solve with it?

[00:54:17] Sue Bryce | This is all marketing. The answer to these questions is marketing clarity 101. Right? Irene, if you answer every question that I'm showing you, that is my pitch. Right?

[00:54:39] Sue Bryce | This is not only my marketing list is how I ask people about this product. Who is it for? Who uses this product? Write a list of people. Is it useful?

[00:54:53] Sue Bryce | Is it desirable? Is it com is it just functional, or is it a must have? Or is it like something so exclusive? Like, what is it? Who is it for?

[00:55:09] Sue Bryce | How do you use it? How do you experience this product? As the person who makes it and sells it, how do you use it? Is it connected to you in any way? Is what you do there connected to you in any way?

[00:55:29] Sue Bryce | Yes, because I made it with my hands. There's a million ways to be connected to it, but you need to tell me how you are connected to it. Why is it valuable? You keep saying it's, like, valuable, but why? Why do you value it?

[00:55:52] Sue Bryce | You. You can't tell me, well, that why that's valuable, then you don't value it. How are you trying to sell something? And why don't you value it? Does it have to solve a problem?

[00:56:06] Sue Bryce | Can it give an experience? It absolutely solves a problem. It always solves a problem, and it absolutely is an experience, even if you're buying online. So it's both of those things.

[00:56:23] Sue Bryce | Let's

[00:56:27] Sue Bryce | see. I am connected because it reminds me of being at home where my mother would tell me I mattered while tucking me in with my favorite blanket. And we're talking about blankets. Sorry. The answer to my question is how to market the experience.

[00:56:42] Sue Bryce | I do better with a template of sorts answering these questions in my marketing authentically. What does it do? Thanks, gents, putting all the questions in there. Okay. So as soon as you can truly answer all of that, and then you have a look at everything you wrote down, that's your marketing right there.

[00:57:01] Sue Bryce | That is the why people want things. Okay. That is it. So answer this question, we're still on the one product don't drift off yet. You can answer yes or no to these ones, and I don't want it in between.

[00:57:15] Sue Bryce | Don't lie. Is it priced for profit? Is this product here priced for profit? I'm gonna have to put my book here because I feel like I keep pointing at my product. Ah, yes or no?

[00:57:28] Sue Bryce | Give me a yes or no out there in the chat. Is it sustainable to produce this product, the service? Is it sustainable? When you work out the most amount of work you can take, how quickly do you hit a glass ceiling? Like, I want to do, 7 clients a month.

[00:57:48] Sue Bryce | Currently, I only have 2. Have you worked out if you do have 7 clients a month and what they'd be paying? How much time it would take you to do that and how much money it would cost you to do that, because do the math first and hit a glass ceiling in your mind before you can even open your mind, the eight people or seven people will come to you a month, do the walk first and say, alright, I could perceive myself having 8 clients a month that spend $5000. Now, 8 clients a month at $5000 will require at least 2 days each from me. Now, have a look at that math.

[00:58:23] Sue Bryce | Do I have 2 days where I can give my undivided attention to these eight people. What happens next month if I only get 4 instead of 8? Because then I have an average of 6 per month, and I want my average to be 8 per month, but I gotta put my average up. So that's where you start going up instead of who's gonna book that? Where are eight people coming from?

[00:58:44] Sue Bryce | Nobody will pay that in this town. Nobody wants that. It's not and you've just told me every reason it's not gonna work for you, whereas what I've done is I've put my product through all of this system, I've connected it to me, I know it's good, now I need to actually think about how I can fulfill the delivery of this service. Will I need to employ somebody? There goes money.

[00:59:10] Sue Bryce | Will I need to employ someone full time? There goes a whole lot of money because that means you're now gonna keep marketing for those eight people. So if you do that sort of glass ceiling on scaling your business, you can definitely see how valuable your time becomes and how quickly you're gonna burn out on the amount of money you said this product is worth. So go back to the top. Is it profitable now?

[00:59:35] Sue Bryce | Is it sustainable to produce now that I've said that? Is it priced for the market? Oh, here's a good one. But the market is different all around the world. No, it's not.

[00:59:48] Sue Bryce | It's only people who value what you do and people who don't value what you do. That's it. That's how different it is. Alright. Do you feel good about selling this product?

[01:00:00] Sue Bryce | Do you feel good about marketing it? Do you feel good about selling this product? Do you feel good about marketing it? Every question I've asked right now, up until this moment, is asking you if you believe in all of those steps. If you don't believe in this step, how can you sell it and market it?

[01:00:25] Sue Bryce | Alright? Any questions? I offer step by step design process for eco conscious individuals who can't afford traditional architectural services. Okay. Good.

[01:00:38] Sue Bryce | Alright. Let me take you to here. So do you currently have an audience or a following, and 2000 people is an audience and a following? 1500 is if you're just starting out, Do you have an audience? What does that audience know about you?

[01:00:59] Sue Bryce | And what does that audience know about this product? Because the crazy putters is when I actually say that to people, they're like, yeah, I'm not really in my brand. A lot of people really don't know anything about me, and I'm the one they have to connect with, book, with, pay money with, and do the work with. What do they know about you and what do they know about this product? Now I'm gonna reverse my slides to hear those are your marketing words that what people want to know about your product.

[01:01:38] Sue Bryce | This is what the audience is saying. What does it do? But you don't really show it or talk about it, so what what do you actually do? Who are you? You've showed a still photograph.

[01:01:52] Sue Bryce | I get it. You're a cute red head, but, like, what does your voice sound like? Are you nice? How can I connect with you? I don't see your face?

[01:02:01] Sue Bryce | Who is it for? Is it for me? Because if if it's for me, then they should see people like me in the marketing, and you already know who your audience is because you know who it's for. And am I the person who it's for? This is what they want to know This is how you build an audience.

[01:02:20] Sue Bryce | Okay. This is what I did. All I ever did was got up and said, Hi, guys. This is what I do. Yay.

[01:02:26] Sue Bryce | Look at me doing it. Not talking about it. I was actually showing people because you show, you don't tell them, what problem do I solve? Everybody thinks they have to be photogenic, but I know there's no such thing. This was all of my marketing was just answering those questions, and and I just kept doing it, because this is what everybody wants to know.

[01:02:49] Sue Bryce | Oh, how do you think it's valuable? Oh, watch other people using it. Oh, look, it is valuable. I love this. I want this experience.

[01:02:59] Sue Bryce | That's how you build an audience. Until you actually answer those questions, you're not marketing to anybody. I actually created a reel this week to post regarding my collections, and I need to post it. Yes, you do, Karen. Go post it.

[01:03:15] Sue Bryce | Okay. So that was really important to me. That was really, really important to me answering every one of those questions. Do you have an audience? What do they know about you?

[01:03:22] Sue Bryce | What do they know about your product? Have you got any social proof? You keep saying, I love this product. It's good. Tell me somebody else who loves it and thinks it's good.

[01:03:35] Sue Bryce | This is not you. Show me social proof. Show me on your social media. Show don't tell. Show somebody doing it.

[01:03:45] Sue Bryce | Show someone receiving it. Show someone loving it. Show somebody freaking out over it. But if you don't have any social proof of you doing this, You're just talking about something, and you have absolutely no social proof. Okay.

[01:04:01] Sue Bryce | Listen up. The most powerful thing that you can do right now is survey your clients. Alright. So when I built the photo platform, I did a marketing class, and I said, Hey, guys, I'm doing a monthly marketing. This is a big marketing class, but before the marketing class, I'm putting out a marketing survey.

[01:04:23] Sue Bryce | Who wants to do a marketing survey? Now normally when you survey your clients, you have to give something away in order to do it. Like you could say I have a $20 Starbucks card, if you want to give everybody a $20 Starbucks card, you don't have to, you could say I've got a $100 Starbucks card for one lucky winner, and all I need you to do is give me some feedback about your marketing and business. For my workshop, and you want as many people to do that survey as you can. So 1586 people did that survey.

[01:04:57] Sue Bryce | And in it, there were 20 paths to marketing And in it, I wrote questions like, have you done your SEO? Yes or no? And at the time, we were still putting Facebook Pixel in, have you put your Facebook Pixel in? Yes, no? Are you actively networking?

[01:05:16] Sue Bryce | Yes, no? And then I did that, you know, and then I get the numbers back. So out of 1586, I see 76% of the people that took the survey have not done SEO So when I'm teaching the class, I put up the SEO, I know 60% of the people in the room had not done it. And so what I did when I saw a big disparaging number was I went straight to Kat at the time, one of the mentors in my group that, specialized in CEO, SEO, sorry, and I sat her down, and I was like, Hey, I've never done SEO. But somebody else did it for my business I paid to, but if I was gonna do it myself, how how would you do it?

[01:06:02] Sue Bryce | And she came and taught a class to everybody on how to do their own basic SEO, which is getting them you know, instantly put into the front pages of Google. So the incredible part about that is as I asked everyone these questions, they weren't lying. And if you're in a room with a thousand people and I'll say, okay, put your hand up if you have not done SEO, you know nothing about SEO, and you are not putting your business like that. And, like, I'd say, 20% of people would be like, But most people are like, I'm not putting my hand up, but I already had those stats. When you survey clients, you can survey them about the experience with you, and you can get direct feedback, but in a survey form, Now, the crazy thing is, is I used to do surveys that were multi choice, yes, no, you know, ABC, whatever, because then I could quantify the results really quickly.

[01:07:06] Sue Bryce | Like, I have 1586 photographers taking this marketing workshop, but I've just found out that 1326 of them aren't going to networking. So this is incredible, and I got all of that information. Now back then, what I used to do is do the multi choice because then it would give me a a percentage Like 86% of people have not done SEO, this many people have not done this, this many people do this, but don't do this, and that was so easy to gather the data for. Now, listen up, now they've changed things, Now what you could do is send a beautiful survey to your clients, make it fun, send them a a $20 gift card. If they're a good client, why wouldn't you do that?

[01:07:55] Sue Bryce | I would love your feedback. In it, you can write things like would you refer me to your friends? Would you come back next year? You're getting direct information, but it's coming in a survey. Now, when you get the results, I can see that the results in your name.

[01:08:13] Sue Bryce | And I know that you filled that out. It's not anonymous, so don't make it so. And then ultimately, I am gathering all of this data from you. And in that, you can even ask, what did we do right, what did we do wrong, could you see a way to improve our business? So the latest surveys that I've been putting out, Craig is AI, Craig, he is, telling me to leave it, like, for them to write.

[01:08:39] Sue Bryce | And I was like, Oh, no. I will not be copying and pasting 1586 comments, and he goes, no, this is what you do now. Now at the bottom, you can write in your own words, can you tell me what it was like having this experience with me, you can copy and paste all of those, put them into AI, and say, could you please write all of my marketing copy based on what these twelve people say about me? And your mind will just go. Here's something else that happened that was so mind blowing about the survey.

[01:09:15] Sue Bryce | When I did that survey and I got 1586 do it, the biggest thing that went online straight away is everybody went straight to my group and wrote, I can tell by the questions you asked, and that survey that I need to sprint towards the next marketing class. Because they were saying no to so many things that I was asking that it was prompting the content to make them go like, Oh, I haven't done that. Oh, shit. She's gonna ask me that, and I had not done that. And suddenly it made them realize I had all the answers.

[01:09:52] Sue Bryce | So the other thing that I see people don't do with their products is beta test them when you beta test a product, whatever it is, you're beta testing it for a testimonial. You're taking somebody through this product, right? And the reason that you're taking them through this product is so that you can watch somebody else experience this product that you love so much. I'm gonna take it back to here, because when you beta test it, these are the questions you want to ask them. When you mark it, those are the questions you wanna answer in your marketing, right?

[01:10:29] Sue Bryce | So when you beta test it, you look at them and you go, what did you think was the best thing about this product? What problem did it solve for you? Why did you think it was for you, like how would you describe yourself? You know, I'm just a stay at home mom, oh, I've noticed all of my clients are moms, you know, you see themes in people, you know, who did you how did you enjoy it the most? Who did you share it with?

[01:10:58] Sue Bryce | How did you use it? If you know beta test your content, then you're selling something that's not selling, you haven't even shown people how to share it, use it, engage in it, experience it. It's there. That's social proof. Alright?

[01:11:13] Sue Bryce | But I want you to start putting out surveys. You know, do you remember when Facebook blew up, this is probably 10, 15 years ago, 15 years ago, where they had all of these quizzes what sort of disney princess are you? You know, what sort of diva are you, and we were all about it. We were all like, you know, what character of sex in the city were you? And we were all just like, yeah.

[01:11:40] Sue Bryce | Yeah. And they were just getting all that data. Every stupid little quizzy, and we put up the memes, and we were like, I'm a bunny, and it's like, oh, I was a tiger. Did you see how many questions they asked you about things that you do? And they got all of that stuff about you.

[01:12:04] Sue Bryce | You know, the golden rule online is if you're not paying for it, you're the product. If you're not paying for it, you are the product. Okay. Oh, I wrote social proof as organic shares from users, testimonials from clients, followers, students, video testimonials are the best, because you can use them on social media. This is where I get really excited.

[01:12:33] Sue Bryce | I see this slide, and instantly my goosey bumps, they goosey, and they bump. The product that you're talking about right now, is it on there that you do? Tell me if if there's something not on there, and I'm gonna read them out. Do you make it? Do you create it yourself?

[01:12:50] Sue Bryce | Do you design it? Do you craft it? Or maybe you build it? Do you maybe manufacture it? Somebody else makes it?

[01:12:58] Sue Bryce | You're just a manufacturer, or maybe you license it. Somebody else makes it. You license it and sell it for a percentage. You can do that. You can license content from other creators and sell it on your website to your audience and get a cut of whatever they're selling, and then you say to the person every month, I sold 24 units, here's your money, or it goes to them, and they give you an affiliate for it.

[01:13:23] Sue Bryce | It is one of the coolest things you can do. Do you import it? Or maybe it's speaking content. You speak it. Do you film it?

[01:13:31] Sue Bryce | Do you teach it? Do you coach it? Which one? I want you to write as many of yours. How many things on there do you do to create this product?

[01:13:44] Sue Bryce | And what else do you do that's not there? I love creative too, Irene. I like create it because I am a creative, even though I make it with my hands. I definitely write it I teach it, I film it, I broadcast it, I podcast it. Okay.

[01:14:00] Sue Bryce | That's very important, and it's something that, you know, but it has to really be connected to me. What is it that I do in order to make this product? Okay. So when people say, what do I talk about in my marketing? That's what I'm interested in.

[01:14:21] Sue Bryce | I'm interested in how you do it. I'm interested in how you use it. I'm interested in why you do it, and I'm interested in why you value it. That's what I'm interested in. So if you look at that and you just take one of them and say, how do I do this?

[01:14:51] Sue Bryce | And you make your marketing about how you create this product or how you sing this product how you practiced, how you wrote it, how you built it, how you suffered for it. It doesn't matter. I'm interested in the how and the why. And if you make it creative, design it, paint it, I wanna see you do that. I wanna know where that comes from, how.

[01:15:16] Sue Bryce | Now if you manufacture it or license it, then maybe you could be doing a real saying, this is how I license other people's creative work, get them paid, get me paid with my audience, and you're teaching other people how to do it. There is always a way to connect what it is that you do, but I'm most interested in those 4 things, and they're all about you, as a creator, as an artist, like, if you're not showing yourself, doing it, valuing it, using it, and you're not telling people why you do it, why are you even interesting as a product or a person? You're not. Chet's gone quiet. Wake up, we need a coffee.

[01:16:01] Sue Bryce | I'm on the last sprint. You invented it. I love that. Tell that story, Ann, because I love inventing stuff. And inventing something is way better than creating it, because it sounds like it's just all yours.

[01:16:15] Sue Bryce | Alright. Did anybody pick up on this door that I opened? And I actually did it on segment 1 of the workshop. So the very first time,

[01:16:27] Sue Bryce | so right then I was probably just word vomiting all over you, but I want you to just tell me

[01:16:27] Sue Bryce | which one of these themes were connected to you personally So I want you to just write a little column personally connected to me, personally connected to my brand, 100% can connect this in my marketing, and I 100% connect this with my business. Which would essentially be marketing, but it doesn't have to be. I need you to think a little bit abstract here. Put your panoramic lens on. We're going wide angle.

[01:17:02] Sue Bryce | Okay. Not tunnel vision. We're not zooming in. This is about pulling back and seeing the big clear vision here so that you don't get stuck. Oh, wicked deja vu.

[01:17:14] Sue Bryce | That's what I just had, wicked deja vu. Okay. Now, this was the door I opened. I said to you, $14,000,000,000 was spent last year, in romance novels. Okay.

[01:17:27] Sue Bryce | Were there any romance novelists in the group that's that went, I think I've must go and walk my truest path. I mean, I woke up this morning and I was thinking about this talk. And instantly, I thought, well, if I wrote a romance novel, what would I kind of write? And I was like, it wouldn't be like a 50 shades of gray, but I'd like I was trying to think of what sort of romance novel I would write. And then I was like, yeah, definitely not my path, but go go get it, 14,000,000,000 there guys.

[01:17:58] Sue Bryce | Like, there's a big market out there, and clearly we we're not fussy about our romance, because that's a lot of money. Alright. But I also put this, and these are all the top selling ebooks. These are also categories for podcasts, loosely, but mostly they

[01:18:13] Sue Bryce | are, ebooks, non fiction. Okay, romance being fiction.

[01:18:13] Sue Bryce | All of these were non fiction, and they're in order of importance of how they sell, which means if we're all buying memoirs and autobiographies, in fact, memoirs and autobiographys are way higher than anything else, because it's right

[01:18:34] Sue Bryce | up there with, you know,

[01:18:34] Sue Bryce | isn't it funny? Romance romance? Cause that's fantasy romance. There's nothing real life about a romance book. Right?

[01:18:44] Sue Bryce | It's like, she had gorilla breath in the morning as I took her, you know, like, no. It's not real life. So memoirs and autobiography is how weird that that's such real life, and that tells me that if you just turn your camera and talk about your business, that's the closest thing you can get to a memoir in autobiography because it's you, owning your energy, owning your confidence, owning your space. Religion and spirituality right out there, and so that tells me if that's a big part of your life, you can 100% bring that into your voice, your marketing, because it's who you are. So when I looked at this, I started to look at it in terms of marketing, and I also started to look at in my CliftonStrengths, I am a relator in my top 5, related comes up really quickly and ideation.

[01:19:37] Sue Bryce | And those 2 gifts bring, no matter what I'm doing, strategy, command, achiever, I'm such a powerhouse, but when I hit my number 4 and my number 5, it slow down and think about it. And then the 5th one is related to everything around you. So I call this marketing on the periphery, because let's say I'm a body builder, and I'm a photographer, then clearly health and wellness is gonna come into a blend of my content, how I connect in marketing, how I show myself to the world, I'm gonna say I'm a body builder, and I photograph body builders, maybe, you know, or I design bikinis for body builders, It doesn't matter. It's whatever you're connected to in your personal self can come into your marketing and into your brand, essentially, because these are connected to who you are. You know, a lot of people wanna travel, and they talk about travel, a lot of people make business out of travel, and a lot of people share a lot of travel on their business.

[01:20:38] Sue Bryce | So how would sharing travel connect to your business? And if you can't find a way to connect travel and your business, and a really cool way to do that would be, I got a special client in Germany. And now here I am in Germany doing what I love, traveling, and working, right? It could be that simple. That's how That's how abstract I'm being, because that means something to you.

[01:21:04] Sue Bryce | And when it means something to you, it's connected, it's in alignment with who you are, and what you're gonna find is in every one of those industries that you are interested in and connected to, that is related to your specialty and your industry, you're gonna find a market of people that want exactly your thing who are interested in this. So there you are, I'm a body builder, I photograph body builders, I put my self out there as a body builder showing my nutrition, ironically, I tracked body builders who then want my photos. It's just that's the beauty of a personal brand. So which ones were you, and are there any questions about how to create or make 2 different things fit together, people will always throw in a really random one. Like, I really like to be a death doula, and I also am a midwife.

[01:21:55] Sue Bryce | So I'd be like, let's we need to be a little bit more careful about how we put these 2 things together, like people will throw me abstracts, but the truth is, is you don't realize how much of one of those things, very strongly, and you, can become part of your personal brand, persona online. Because that's what connects people. I created a photo book that shares human stories of Blackmen because they feel the truth of who they are is overlooked. I don't see how it's directly related to any of these themes. Maybe autobiography, self help, and craft.

[01:22:30] Sue Bryce | That's exactly what it is. So, it could be, 100%. I would say self help, it could be, memoirs and autobiography. So you know, but there's always a way. There's always a way to connect it, but hang on.

[01:22:46] Sue Bryce | You're missing the golden rule. I'm assuming if you made a photo book, you're a photographer. Okay. You're not all photographers in this group, so stop talking like you're all photographers. Because I retired from photography.

[01:22:57] Sue Bryce | I'm teaching business here right now, so you've got to be more specific. So if you did a photography book and you're a photographer, why do you need to relate it to anything else? I think you got it covered. My design approach is rooted in care, which is why I feel a strong connection between my business and health and wellness. Yes.

[01:23:17] Sue Bryce | Yes. I love that. Okay. No more questions, ask me questions if they pop up. Nobody wants to ask about how to relate any of those, you will get that?

[01:23:26] Sue Bryce | Because I thought maybe people didn't get that, and I was like, that to me was like a golden list of marketing. For real. I was like, Wow. Alright. Anybody wanna develop a new product or talk about creating a brand new service that is not reviving an old one, but if you have any questions about that, free feel free to ask them right now.

[01:23:49] Sue Bryce | And I just wanna finish while I'm getting those questions, and any other questions you might wanna ask with this slide, which I showed you day 1, is how long will it take to change, and build an income. This is the question I am most asked, how long will this take, and how quickly could I build an income? And I have learned that that's when I look at them and say, well, how strong is your vision? How strong is your clarity? How strong is your connection to this product?

[01:24:27] Sue Bryce | That's how fast it's gonna take you. Because the sooner you create the

[01:24:31] Sue Bryce | connection there, you are unstoppable.

[01:24:31] Sue Bryce | Because there's nothing stopping me from selling When I love this, there is nothing stopping me now from putting it out there. I've ticked all the boxes. It's valuable. I know it's good. What's gonna stop me now?

[01:24:51] Melissa | How do you know if you need a stronger connection or just a new product?

[01:24:56] Sue Bryce | Okay. So I would think it comes down to I don't love it. And I don't think you need a new product. I think you need a new web looking at the product you have. And or acknowledging the crossroad of, is it time for me to evolve, or is it time for me to replenish?

[01:25:19] Sue Bryce | Cause so often, we just jaded with selling because we're in bad money energy, and so it's we're getting a lot of rejection. And when you're in a bad money, do do, you just attract people that tell you you're worthless, and it's so heartbreaking because you just feel more worthless And it's a cycle you have to get your own head out of, but it comes down to value.

[01:25:43] Melissa | If you call them and they don't answer or you have a conversation and they don't pay the deposit, how often do you follow-up before you give up?

[01:25:51] Sue Bryce | Well, you can tell if somebody's connected on the call. And again, why are you talking to them on the phone if you can get them in person that's gonna work better, but honestly if somebody doesn't take your call, definitely try a few more times, but, like, I wouldn't be like, next day. I'd be like, Thursday, I'm gonna follow-up with Melissa. And then in a week, if you rang me in in that I was busy, and I was like, oh, I can't take that now, and then you rang back in a week you run back tomorrow morning, I'd be like, God, this woman won't stop. Okay?

[01:26:24] Sue Bryce | Cause I'm stressed out, but if you rang me in a week, yeah, and if you emailed me and said, hey, no pressure, just whenever you want to, nobody will get anything. So just chill out and wait a week, and then drop in a week and say, hi, Fran. I know you're busy, but I just wanted to circle back and see if I can get you on my calendar for next month. It's that simple. And if they say, look, I'm slammed, go call and ring you in November.

[01:26:51] Sue Bryce | Give you 2 months. Ciao. Have a great day. You know, or if they say, you know what? No.

[01:26:57] Sue Bryce | You called last week. I was busy. This week, I really just can't do this right now, so the answer is no. And you just go, Hey, you know where I am. Life gets busy, man.

[01:27:09] Sue Bryce | So if you want me next month or the next month, you've got my number. It's okay. Thank you so much for your time. Like, go into their life for a moment, and remember how many times you do that, how many times you don't pick up a call because someone's screaming in the house, the dog just pooped on the floor, someone's knocking on the front door, and you're like, And all you do is look at the phone and go, no, right now. And that has nothing to do with you.

[01:27:38] Sue Bryce | It has everything to do with me. So they just don't be like a psycho, you know, like, don't park outside their house and be like, I sent an email 3 days ago, because if you need money that badly, you're stinky, and that's probably what's stopping them from connecting to you anyway. I've never made an ebook. What is a practical way to produce it and deliver it specifically? What software or company do you recommend?

[01:28:04] Sue Bryce | I have the words and I need the format, delivery format? Well, you know what? I've never paid anybody. I created an ebook myself. I didn't use a program.

[01:28:14] Sue Bryce | I just used I just did it on pages, and then I all the ebooks that I did, for SBE were basically magazines. So I just did magazine templates. So then I did all those design templates because they're predesigned and they look magazine style, and I felt like a magazine style, but there are so many places that makes ebooks that can design them for you, but ultimately e book is a product that will live on your e commerce store. And if you're going to give it away or sell it, it will be on there as a product. You can also, maybe ask that question in the group and anybody that's done it through specific things.

[01:28:59] Sue Bryce | We'll give you the feedback in the group. That might help, but that I did them all myself. That's how I've done all my ebook. So yeah. Yeah.

[01:29:07] Sue Bryce | More questions, and then I'll wrap it up. Any questions from in here? Everyone's so quiet in here? I need to know if this made a difference today, like what we're talking about. Are you seeing your product now?

[01:29:25] Sue Bryce | You're seeing it like that, just sitting on the table where we can all look at it? And if you're wondering why this thing that, you know, is supposed to bring you your mortgage payment every month, then shouldn't you love it? And if you want people to spend 100 or 1000 of dollars on it and come back over and over again, shouldn't you love doing it?

[01:29:48] Sue Bryce | And

[01:29:51] Sue Bryce | if it going to pay for your children's college and your trip to Europe next year and hit your Thrive budget, shouldn't you give it all the love and energy that you could possibly give it? And if you make it yourself and you design it yourself and you haven't gotten to a place where that's valuable, you don't believe you're valuable, and you can do that work. That's the biggest one. Alright? Ask me questions.

[01:30:37] Sue Bryce | You want no questions? Alright. I don't mind if there's no I'll go, okay, I'll sign out, and then I get 5 questions. So I was like, nobody here has a question, and nobody online has a question. Okay.

[01:30:47] Sue Bryce | What I want you to do this week is get the homework from Jen. Jen so lovingly wrote in the group last week, do you prefer? See how she designs my beautiful slides and she designs my beautiful slides, and they're gray, and they're cream, and they're gold, and they're very on brand. But when you go to print them, she takes all the color off the background so that you can print them without printing pages of dark gray, and black. And then she asked everybody in the group, do you prefer to keep the design online, or would you like me to take the color away and print them?

[01:31:23] Sue Bryce | And it was a 5050. 50% of the people were like, we love to print it, and the other 50% were like, keep the dark color. So now she's doing both, because that was very nice of her to give you an option, instead of just like, suck it, you guys are getting this. And, so basically you're gonna get all of the slides that you see. And when you get those slides, I want you to take a product, the new product, the next product, the product you have, and I want you just to put it on the table, and I need you to answer every question that I asked you about that product until you could truly tell me that you're in love with it and that you can sell it.

[01:32:01] Sue Bryce | So there was this feeling that I got when I, when I realized those cards were the most valuable thing I'd made. I was like I felt after all those years of making photographs, I would always compare myself. And because I was never the best in my craft, I always felt like I was never quite good enough. But finally, I could create something that I couldn't compare to anybody else because it so intrinsically came from me. And the day that I held that product, I cried, and I cried the cry of connection and value that I've never felt in my career, And from that day, I know the day.

[01:32:59] Sue Bryce | I know the date. I know the time I stood there. It is like my will just goes tunnel vision when I think of it. I have not been able to stop making money. I had a $1,000,000 studio before that, and I struggled to make money.

[01:33:22] Sue Bryce | And for myself, and the day that I held that product. I just knew I was good enough for the world. I just knew it. Like, I just knew it, and I felt it. So the grief I felt by leaving my camera for now, because it could just be burnout, was, what if I never feel this love again?

[01:33:50] Sue Bryce | What if I never feel this value again with what I do that's new? What if I never get back to that synergy? Cause it wasn't like the money I didn't really have any money until I made that product. I had money, but it was just falling away. When I made that, everything went like that.

[01:34:13] Sue Bryce | It made me feel valuable to me. And then it didn't matter what anybody else said. It was every time I showed up holding that. And then the irony, I'm so goosy right now, the irony is I'm getting up on stage, selling and showing this product, Say, how could I not go around the world in 1 year? I'm literally doing the one thing that nobody else is doing.

[01:34:39] Sue Bryce | I'm standing up, showing my work, not look at me, but look how I do this. You can do it too. Like I was like, have the information, and people were like, and I was like, I love this so much. Like, look what I've created. They're amazing.

[01:34:54] Sue Bryce | I'd stand up on stage and I'd fly to me and people would line up for hundreds of them. 100 of 1000 of dollars, I sold just from that one product, and I was like, and it changed my whole world because I felt valuable. That's it. Yeah.

[01:35:13] Melissa | When you desire a new path, how do you narrow down which one to follow? Multiverse it until it feels right?

[01:35:19] Sue Bryce | You know what? You gotta stop pretending like there's multiple paths available. Truthfully. You can walk a path in a million different ways, but when you say to people, are you really lit up by the path in front of you? If they say I just don't know what path to pick, you don't have a path.

[01:35:37] Sue Bryce | So you think there's 10 empty paths that you're gonna fulfill you tell me you tell me the one thing that would break your heart if you didn't do it. You know, a lot of people some people struggle with finding out their love language. You read that book about love languages. And this is how I get people to find out what their love language is. What is the one thing if your partner didn't do it would hurt your feelings?

[01:36:01] Sue Bryce | Like if my husband didn't say I love you, and he left, I wouldn't be like, I need the words of affirmation, you know, But if he didn't hug me, I'd be like, that's my love language, dude, not to be hugged.

[01:36:15] Sue Bryce | Got it.

[01:36:17] Sue Bryce | So you know what I mean? It's like it's one of those things. So it was the what was the one thing that would hurt you if you didn't do it? What was the one thing that would truly and then you're like, oh, yeah. I could handle not doing that.

[01:36:28] Sue Bryce | It wasn't having it, it was not having it. So have a look there. If I didn't walk that path with that one path that truly is that that's the path I'm gonna walk awards, choose you the scariest one. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome.

[01:36:46] Sue Bryce | How often

[01:36:48] Melissa | should you send emails?

[01:36:53] Sue Bryce | How long does a piece of string?

[01:36:57] Melissa | And one more question that I think is really great. Do you have a daily ritual, or do you have a ritual before you go on stage?

[01:37:05] Sue Bryce | Yes. I do. We were just talking about that. I'm just about to publish the real, actually, because I looked at the footage from the workshop, and Jason's got Kellan's putting my mic on, and I'm going like this. Right?

[01:37:19] Sue Bryce | And then he walks past, and then he comes back, I'm still doing it in the video. And I was like, oh, I'm so programmed to do this. I didn't realize I'd still do it. This is adrenaline. And what you do is you process your adrenaline and you start doing a yoga breath, And that means when I walk up on stage, the adrenaline doesn't overwhelm me.

[01:37:37] Sue Bryce | But right before I walk up on stage, I ground my feet, and I call in, god light and energy, and I say that that anyone can

[01:37:47] Sue Bryce | speak through me for the highest good of everybody in this room

[01:37:47] Sue Bryce | and watching. And I trust my voice. I say that to myself, I trust you. I trust you. When you start speaking, you're going to say the right thing.

[01:38:03] Sue Bryce | I trust that whatever comes out of your mouth is the highest good for me and everybody in this room. Then I said an intention Okay. So today, it's an easy intention today. Today, my intention is for you to fall in love with your product. Can you see how

[01:38:20] Sue Bryce | goosey I get? So, see, when I said it intention,

[01:38:20] Sue Bryce | it meant something to me, and then I know that it's the truth, because then I tell you what my intention is, and if you don't see goosebumps, you didn't get my real intention. And you can ask me what my intention is anytime because if I energetically speak through my intention, regardless of what I prepare to say to you, if I energetically are connected to that intention, you can feel that it's palpable, because intention is that that you know, fuel in your rocket, it's the reason you're doing it, it's the why, and the intention for me is super, super, super powerful because, it has to come from a place of this is for you This is not about me, so my intention has to be for you. Not about me. There's no my intention is to do well today. Who would stay there?

[01:39:18] Sue Bryce | Like, yes, I want to do well. I hope to do well, but my intent in is that I trust myself enough to know that I will be able to answer your questions, solve your problems, feel your responses, learn from you, connect with you so that I can get more to solve more of your problems as you get better and better at what you do. Yeah. So that to me is like my process, and I also know, afterwards I used to experience massive self hate whenever I see the photos from stage or reels. And now I just love every photo, regardless of if I'm like, horsey or or or bad light, it doesn't matter.

[01:40:02] Sue Bryce | I think of the energy I've experienced in that change, and I know it's not about bad lighting or anything. Terry taught me that. Terry taught me that you should, you know, like I would try and get rid of the bad photos to me, and that one guy, and I message him, was he, could you take that photo down? It was horrendous. And he was like, wow, all I saw was a powerful woman in her full power.

[01:40:29] Sue Bryce | And I was I felt horrified that I asked him to take it down because what a beautiful thing to see and say about me, that's not what I saw about me, and I had to get over that really quickly. Now that I'm older and I'm in my fifties, I'm not trying to look young anymore. I want wrinkles, and, you know, I'm just I didn't get great hair, and I'm pissed about it. My mother was so is silver white bulb, by 35, silver white bulb, I don't have gray hair. I don't have gray hair.

[01:41:03] Sue Bryce | I get these little new highlights put in, which I think are great, but I was like, are there any gray? And she's like, no, not yet. I have like 3 here. You can come up and check, And I'm like, I don't want people to think I'm dying my hair. I wanna be silver.

[01:41:19] Sue Bryce | I wanna be a silver fox with silver hair. No. And also people always say you're like a fourteen year old girl, like, when I I'm like, walking down the street, and somebody will see me, and I'll be like, hi, my friend was like, oh, why's that kid waving at me? And I was like, it's me. And she was like, oh, I thought you were a kid.

[01:41:38] Sue Bryce | And I was like, ah, I get told that all the time, right? You're fourteen. So I'm like, when am I gonna look like an old woman? And then I was like, well, no Botox will do that, so we'll see how this goes. But I don't feel like I'm aging well enough, and I wanna be I don't wanna I don't wanna be like a housewife.

[01:41:58] Sue Bryce | I don't wanna be like, I don't wanna do that, and I wanna be, like, myself. And I just think, you know, it's just one of those things, but, like, I wish that I could embrace my older self more. I'll just have to get more wrinkly and more grumpy.

[01:42:16] Melissa | I think that's what's making you look younger.

[01:42:19] Sue Bryce | Right.

[01:42:19] Melissa | Is that attitude right there?

[01:42:21] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Probably. Probably. Alright. Thank you so much.

[01:42:24] Sue Bryce | Alignment with your product. You need to be in love with it. If you're not in love with it, restore, or create something new. But before you create something new, look at why you were not in love with it. So really go back through those questions and answer them.

[01:42:40] Sue Bryce | People have this way whenever I say these are all your marketing things, to then go and put those 9 things in one marketing post. And I'm like, quite not quite what I meant, so don't be literal here. I don't want you to be like, hey, guys, what do you do? Why do you do it? How do you do it?

[01:42:58] Sue Bryce | And, and and all that, and then you gotta get 17 likes, 4 of them were family members, 2 of them were staff. Okay. And the point being is I just gave you 5 years of marketing, and you just blew it in one load. Okay. So say think about the long game.

[01:43:15] Sue Bryce | Think about the long game. Have we got a microphone down here? Oh, yeah. There you go.

[01:43:23] Sue Bryce | So I know social proof is really important.

[01:43:26] Sue Bryce | Yes. And

[01:43:27] Sue Bryce | I know video testimonials are even more important.

[01:43:29] Sue Bryce | Mhmm.

[01:43:30] Sue Bryce | I think it's a chicken and the egg sort of situation. And I know my approach the way I would do it would be to actually help some people with my product.

[01:43:40] Sue Bryce | Beta test it.

[01:43:42] Sue Bryce | Yep. And then their payment to me is a video test.

[01:43:45] Sue Bryce | Exactly right.

[01:43:46] Sue Bryce | Okay. That is the point of beta testing. So you don't pick people,

[01:43:46] Sue Bryce | unless you're gonna really move their needle. Because people don't you don't want a fake testimonial, right? You want the kind of testimonial where Jo just coached me and changed my business. Like, that's what you want. So you have to, like, interview to beta test.

[01:44:09] Sue Bryce | You cannot give this product to people that are not going to use it. Now, if you gave it to a friend and said, Hey, use my my product, and they're like, cool. And then they go, it's a great product. I'm gonna put it on Instagram. My friend made this, look, guys, I use it in my business, But if you don't use it, that is a fake, there is no authenticity in the voice, you can feel it, and also they're not saying why they love it and how they use it.

[01:44:36] Sue Bryce | They're just showing it, and it's you're not supposed to just show. You're supposed to show how you use it, show why you love it, show other people doing it, and using it. So another cool thing, I think, coaching, like if you wanna sell workshops, and you've never sold a workshop, you have to coach first, because you'd need to get one on one clients before you can get a a group of twenty people. And that's where I think people make the biggest mistake, because they're not pre prepared to coach five people for free. And you have to.

[01:45:11] Sue Bryce | Cause you move three needles, and you have 3 mind blowing testimonials. Not to mention three people that will throw down for anything you've got going on. So you've gotta pick your people really, really well. Yeah. But the surveying, get that started.

[01:45:30] Sue Bryce | Get a SurveyMonkey account or whatever you wanna use, and really think about how you can connect in a survey and help people and how it will help your business by getting that data. Yeah? Continually put the product on the table and ask every question there, because even if you went to a business coach that knew nothing about your business, your industry, they're just a business coach, and they sat you down, they'd say, tell me about your brand, tell me about your product, they're gonna ask you every question that I asked you there, and it's going to very quickly tell me whether you're connected to this product or not. It's that simple. Now can you be connected to a product that you're not in love with?

[01:46:18] Sue Bryce | Yes. Okay. Imagine I'll use Starbucks as an example. Imagine I could buy a Starbucks franchise. Right?

[01:46:32] Sue Bryce | And it's a $1,000,000, but I'll make a $1,000,000 in the 1st year. And my everything about me is buying businesses that make money while I sleep that run themselves, so a franchise is gonna be perfect for me. It's what I'm focused on. It's what I want. That is my passion.

[01:46:51] Sue Bryce | Do I have to love the coffee? No. Do I have to love the franchise? Yes. Because they have to work within the franchise model, and if I get in the model and I'm like, I don't like these rules, I don't like the senior executives, then it's a no, but it doesn't mean I have to love the coffee.

[01:47:11] Sue Bryce | I can just love buying businesses that give my money, my family wealth, and safety, and security by not being there when I run them. That's just what what is my greatest passion. So I think people see Sue falling in love with the product and sew's all like this, and you're thinking, but I don't even like Starbucks coffee. I'm not asking you to stand at the front door with the coffee, your job is to own be the landlord. Now, maybe landlord is your wealth dynamic.

[01:47:44] Sue Bryce | And the idea of owning something and helping pay all these people in a ecosystem is exactly your warehouse. I'm telling you to fall in love with the whole point of what you're doing. That's the secret. That's the magic. Yeah.

[01:48:01] Sue Bryce | It's truly, like, it doesn't really it doesn't have to be that I'm so in love with the product, you know? Will you have questions for the survey in the group? Yeah. You can, yep, take questions, you can ask me survey questions all day every day. Now, we still don't have everyone in the group, but join whenever you're ready, You've noticed on the tabs on the left, personal brand, that's where all the conversation is going on.

[01:48:26] Sue Bryce | If you need me, you can ask me questions there. I love questions. You can also send me a private message. I see now on there, on the group, if you wanna send me a private message so that nobody else can send the message. See the message shift's fine.

[01:48:40] Sue Bryce | That's fine. And thank you so much, because the more you give me, in questions, in stuckness, and feedback, the more I learn, and the more I can create for you and the steps moving forward, and we've just spent a couple of weeks running uphill. But once you fall in love with all that hard work, we're gonna run downhill. Like, seriously, let's do it. Woo hoo.

[01:49:09] Sue Bryce | Thank you.

[01:49:16] Sue Bryce | Yeah.
