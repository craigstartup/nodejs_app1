SUBJECT: Have you heard my Self Value series?

PREVIEW TEXT: Two years ago I created an 18-talk collection.

FROM: SUE BRYCE (team@suebryce.com)

Do you know about my Self Value PowerTalks series?
 
Two years ago, I created a series of talks to help us see ourselves differently and engage better with the world. Many of us feel stuck, or struggle with money issues that hold us back. This series helps tackle self-doubt, unclear goals, and slow personal growth.
 
I invite everyone to join this journey. Learn to align your life and career with your values. Each session aims to bring you joy and purpose.

[GET THE POWERTALKS COLLECTION FOR $49]

In 18 talks over 6 hours, we explore self-discovery and personal growth. From understanding self-love to aligning passions with actions, each session will boost your personal worth.
 
Here's what you will uncover:
 
Business — Unlock your professional potential. Align your actions with your values for authentic work.
 
Relationships — Improve all your relationships with true self-worth. Enhance connections and communication.
 
Personal Happiness — Break down barriers to happiness. Replace self-doubt with joy and purpose.
 
Financial Stability — Change your view on money from fear to abundance. Align self-worth with financial freedom.
 
This is a lot to promise and self-value can be an abstract idea. But I want as many people as possible to hear these talks. If you buy and don't connect with the message, email me and I'll give a full refund. No questions asked. If you do connect, please leave a review on the course page to help others.
 
Join me on this path of self-discovery!
 
Sue Bryce
