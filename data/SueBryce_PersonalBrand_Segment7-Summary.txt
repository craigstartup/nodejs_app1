Segment 7 - Putting Yourself Out There

In this segment of the Personal Brand course, I dive deeply into how important it is to view marketing not just as a means to sell, but as a fundamental expression of clarity and value in your business. Marketing isn't simply about posting on social media or running advertisements; it's about making a clear and attractive presentation of who you are, what you do, and why it matters. This approach shifts the emphasis from transactional interactions to fostering genuine connections and clarity around your personal brand and offerings.

One of the key concepts I share is how managing the 'little monsters' - those self-doubts and fears about our abilities and worth - is critical in how we present ourselves and our businesses. To visualize these abstract feelings, I use the playful metaphor of turning these doubts into illustrated 'monsters' that can be managed and controlled. This creative approach helps in recognizing that these fears and doubts are common and can be tackled in a productive way.

Another significant aspect I discuss is the notion of 'clarity' in marketing. If there's a problem in your marketing strategy, often it's rooted in a lack of clarity. Whether it's about the money, your service, or your product, mastering the ability to clearly and concisely describe what you are offering is paramount. This doesn't just help in marketing, but is a fundamental part of the entire business operation, aligning closely with the product and its value to your customers.

Also, I delve into how people commonly mistake posting for marketing. There's a vital difference — marketing is about brand awareness, connection, and engagement. It's not necessarily making a sale directly but aims to build a relationship with the potential customer. This preparation and groundwork make the actual selling process more effective and smoother.

One of my favorite ways to illustrate effective marketing is through the analogy of removing 'self-doubt' from the driver's seat of a car, symbolizing your business journey. Fear and self-doubt should never dictate the direction of your marketing strategy. Instead, understanding and articulating the value of what you offer, both emotionally and logically, should drive your promotional efforts.

Turning towards the practical application of this kind of marketing, I emphasize the importance of sharing not just the benefits but the joy and the experiences tied to your services or products. Real, authentic stories and experiences resonate more and connect on a deeper level, which are more likely to convert into sales.

I also touch upon the issue many entrepreneurs have with the feeling of impostor syndrome or feeling like a 'fraud' in their ventures. The solution lies in mastery and action— the more you practice your craft, and the more you immerse yourself in your business, the confidence follows naturally.

I conclude by discussing the strategic side of reaching significant revenue goals through calculated steps, such as understanding how many units of a service or product you need to sell to reach a monetary target. The key is not to be overwhelmed by large figures like reaching a million dollars in sales but to break that down into manageable, concrete steps — how many customers per day, week, or month.

Overall, I urge participants to think of marketing not as a daunting task but as part of a grander narrative of their business, which is an exciting and continuous process of clarifying, sharing, and connecting. The ultimate goal is not just to sell but to engage deeply with your customers, providing undeniable value that speaks for itself. Through consistent effort, clarity of message, and genuine interaction, your business is not just selling a product or service; it's offering a part of a well-thought-out brand that resonates and builds lasting relationships.
