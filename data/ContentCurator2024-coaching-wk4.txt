==== Start of Transcript: Content Curator - Week 4 Coaching ====

[00:00:08] Sue Bryce |  We're having a party here today. There's so many of us. We are really having a party. Hi, everyone. How are you doing there.

[00:00:17] Sue Bryce |  Tell me where you're coming in from Montreal, Florida. It's good to see you. We've got a really good group in the studio today, and we're having lots a fun, and we're talking. I'm gonna cut off this coaching at 15 minutes past one today. So you have me for an hour and 15 minutes.

[00:00:34] Sue Bryce |  Hit me with as many questions as you can. Melissa is here in the chat. Jen is also here to help us Jen Swinine. Melissa's here as my chat host. And let's get started.

[00:00:44] Sue Bryce |  How did you go with your bones? Let's talk about structure and time because I know that there's a few people in this room that have got some good questions for me. Oh, hello, Scotland. DC, Michigan, Nashville, New Hampshire, Oh, very good. South Florida, Ohio.

[00:01:05] Sue Bryce |  Alright. So what I wanna start off with this? For those podcasters that got stuck last week that are like, I'm doing podcasting and this creating of the content is for workshops and coaching tracks. Yes. It is.

[00:01:19] Sue Bryce |  But your podcasting track is also a checklist. And if you have activated on every one of those steps on your podcast list. That's what I want you to be doing is activating on every one of those podcast steps. Now you're still going to use this system for your brand story, your bio, and your sales page. So if you're only podcasting, You're still gonna create and break down content for your brand story, your bio, and your sales page and basically any content for reels or videos that you do or marketing videos.

[00:01:57] Sue Bryce |  Now we're looking at the content that's coming out of us. A lot of questions came up about timelines, and people were like, timeline and brand story are getting mishmash. Well, the timeline is the timeline in which you achieved everything, and I just need you to know it backwards forward sideways in out up side down and in all different types of lighting. Once you know that, your brand story is woven throughout that because these are facts And your brand story is a narrative. And between the nuts and the bolts and the fruit, the the wait a minute.

[00:02:31] Sue Bryce |  Meat and potatoes. And then the brand story is that beautiful narrative around how you got to all those points. Now we're looking at time structure right now. This slide is simply. It's either days, weeks, months.

[00:02:45] Sue Bryce |  It's verticals. It's steps, its titles, its segments, its videos, its chapters, its slides. Which one is it for you? So now that you look at this, all of our marketing, we use these words. In our marketing, we could do 28 days, 12 weeks, 12 months, 8 verticals, 10 steps, 12 titles, 12 segments, 48 videos, like 23 chapters, 90 slides, Everything is curated and structured around time and numbers.

[00:03:17] Sue Bryce |  When you sell in your clarity, what am I getting? What are the assets of this workshop, and that's a really good one. Let's talk about ethics. So I did say once you've got all the content out, is it a book, is it a workshop, Is it a keynote? Is it a template?

[00:03:33] Sue Bryce |  Is it a training video? Is it a sales video? Is it a coaching track? I also said to everybody in this room, I guarantee 99 of you already decided what the product was before you started writing it down. Even though it only made you work on the subject, And then the content around that subject, most of you know if you're trying to create a workshop, you're trying to create a workshop, you had that in your head.

[00:03:56] Sue Bryce |  So let me get workshop podcast. You're gonna go through your checklist, and you're going to focus on this system to write your bio, your sales page in all copy around your podcast so that it's awesome for workshoppers, coaches. This is something that I visually see. When I look at a workshop, a 3 day workshop, I see 12:90 minute keynotes. When it's live broadcast, you have to allow for a 15 minute break.

[00:04:28] Sue Bryce |  So if you take 15 minutes off a 90 minute segment, that's usually what you're faced with. It's usually an hour and 15 minutes on a live segment when there's a classroom because we have to break have a 15 minute physical break and come back. That's why it's 90 minutes. But when it's in person, it tends to be the whole 90 minutes. Like, we're all gonna stop now, have lunch, go and use the bathroom, be back here in 30 minutes kind of thing.

[00:04:56] Sue Bryce |  So when I see a workshop, that what I see. Exactly. And I see it like that. I see 12 segments. And when I wrote 12 segments to my 3 day workshop, I knew I had to hold people's attention for 90 minutes, 12 times.

[00:05:11] Sue Bryce |  And maybe one of those segments could be you going away to journal and there you go. That takes away one whole 90 minute segment. They can go away and reflect on everything they've learned today. Maybe it can be roundtable or hot seat. Number 10 could be everyone's gonna do a hot seat.

[00:05:28] Sue Bryce |  In 90 minutes, all of you are gonna get up and talk for 2 minutes. We're doing that today, by the way. Surprise. Alright. You know what?

[00:05:38] Sue Bryce |  Nobody freaks out. Everyone went like, okay. We're doing that. We're doing that. Yeah.

[00:05:42] Sue Bryce |  We're doing that. I can do that. Here I am. She's not gonna make me do this if I'm not ready. But everyone looks like quite good about here.

[00:05:52] Sue Bryce |  So that's what it is for me. It was that 12 segments. And then I realized my 12 segments became 28 days. So I had so many drop downs from the 12 verticals. I was making 12 verticals.

[00:06:05] Sue Bryce |  It was very clear I could make 28 days So either 28 days 28 days became 28 videos, and then 28 videos became 12 weeks 12 weeks became 12 months. 12 months became 12 verticals. 2012, the content grows So if it's not growing as fast as you are hoping it to, the growth of that content in front of you took me 6 years of constant work. Slow your flow down. Calm down people.

[00:06:40] Sue Bryce |  You are trying to unfold this new identity in yourself, this growth in your business, this new skill set you're trying to harness your mastery and create new products out of it. But like I just said to Angie, when when she walked in, you're not new at this, baby. You've been around this mountain before. You're not just creating a business from scratch. And if you are, then your road may take a little longer, but for everybody else up the mountain, you go around, you go, same view, different altitude.

[00:07:10] Sue Bryce |  Now you're not like, am I gonna to create a new product? Now you're like, now I wanna create this new product. How do I do that? Oh, it's scary. It's scary as all hell.

[00:07:19] Sue Bryce |  Yes. It is, but it's all of fun and guess what's on the other side of scary and fun, money. Get out of the way. Shut up. Get out of the way.

[00:07:30] Sue Bryce |  Shut up. Get out of the way. Alright? Just say that to yourself a few times. Shut up and get out of the way.

[00:07:36] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Self doubt. Get out of the car. It's just that easy. Keep walking.

[00:07:41] Sue Bryce |  So when I look at this workshop, that's what I see. If if that was a coaching track, I see 12 weeks. If that was a year's coaching, I see 12 months. If that was a master class, I see 12 videos. If that was a business class, I see 12 verticals.

[00:07:57] Sue Bryce |  Guess how many verticals are on SBE? Yes. 12. That's how it happens. Let it unfold.

[00:08:03] Sue Bryce |  Let it come. Okay? Let it come out. And everything you are creating right now is based around time and structure, days, weeks, months, verticals, minutes, steps, titles, segments, videos, chapters, slides. One of the questions in the room before we started was how do you know you're putting enough meat and veg into your presentation?

[00:08:24] Sue Bryce |  And I was like, when you break down the timeline, I was like, of a talk, and you've, like, got 90 minutes to talk, and you've got 30 slides, and you can talk about each slide for 3 minutes. I wanna make sure there's meat and veg being served on all thirty slides. That's how you know. You're gonna get up there and you're just gonna give value and give value and give value and give value. So do you record your live workshops and have them become an online education product?

[00:08:50] Sue Bryce |  Let's look at the assets around this. And this is a really good way to show you, and I've used this workshop. We'll come back to this. Does anybody wanna make an x $100,000 this year. An extra $100,000 this year while you sleep.

[00:09:10] Sue Bryce |  Okay. We're gonna do that next. But first, let's just look at the assets to this workshop. The assets created around this workshop is so writing for 6 months to get all the content down that she knows everybody needs to curate content. Then with this, you're going to get 6 prerecorded videos, and they are all on the library.

[00:09:33] Sue Bryce |  So, yes, I filmed those first 6, knowing that you would watch them, and then be live with me for the coaching. So the assets for this workshop are 6 videos, 6 weeks live, 6 weeks of downloadable homework thank you to Jen Switine from team, get shit done. And if you need somebody, if you need a team in your business, to get shit done. That's what that woman does. She has a team of people that get shit done for you.

[00:10:00] Sue Bryce |  She was, Jen gets shit done. And then she got so good at it. It had to be team gets it done, though. It's truly. Jen did all of our homework.

[00:10:07] Sue Bryce |  Thank you, Jen. I love you. And she's also my brain coach. For those that are a little spicy and need a little neurodiverse help. Assets, assets, assets, assets.

[00:10:17] Sue Bryce |  We have a bonus video because I talk for half an hour reading through the steps to the podcast for people as to why I had each step there. That is a bonus video. It was off curriculum We added it as a bonus. Now when I sell it, I go 6 videos, 6 weeks live, 6 weeks of downloadable homework, and a bonus video on podcasts. But on, boom, all downloadable templates for your paths to move forward.

[00:10:41] Sue Bryce |  These are assets. So number 1, video number number 1, the video is the information. Number 2, the live is the connection. Number 3, the homework is the interaction. That's what you have in front of you when I'm not in front of you on the TV When you turn the TV off, you're looking at that homework.

[00:11:01] Sue Bryce |  The bonus is just added value. The downloads, the templates are touched feel again when I'm not there, you are holding something step by step that is teaching you how to take the next step And the most beautiful part about that is it makes it quantifiable because now you have to work through the homework and you're working in quantifiable steps. And why I teach a bullet point is because it's now quantifiable. Now we're gonna make a product. Then we're gonna beta test a product.

[00:11:36] Sue Bryce |  Then we're gonna launch it then we're gonna sell it. And as you quantify every one of those steps, I'm getting data, I'm getting evidence I just got my first 10,000 new followers on Instagram. I just got my first 100,000. I just made And we always target selling. You'll get to this in week 5 6 where I'm like, we're gonna sell 10 units.

[00:11:58] Sue Bryce |  We're gonna sell 2 a 100 units. We're gonna sell a 1000 units. We're gonna sell 10,000. We're gonna sell a 100,000. We're gonna sell a million units.

[00:12:05] Sue Bryce |  We break down our our products and units, and we start moving them. And selling them like money making machines. The assets that you need, tell me something. Do you see this all these assets here, the video, the live, the homework, the bonus, and the downloads, do you see that as coaching or a workshop? Both.

[00:12:27] Sue Bryce |  Anybody else coaching or a workshop? Which one would you prefer to call it? Coaching or an online workshop? But I also have a live component, and I'm also here. Out of the eight products you can make, how many taps have I just turned on?

[00:12:41] Sue Bryce |  And did I call it a workshop? Yes. I did. I said I did a content curated workshop with live coaching plus bonus for this amount of money with added value. Okay.

[00:12:54] Sue Bryce |  See how I'm not getting caught up on whether I'm coaching or teaching a workshop. I just keep adding value and turned on as many taps. What would make all my taps on around this workshop is if I created merchandise around it. Right? If I created a podcast around it and then created audio files, that means I'm ticking all eight boxes I'm ticking all eight product boxes on one lot of content.

[00:13:19] Sue Bryce |  See how we're gonna turn on all of our taps. Alright. Information connection. When hiring a team to film, do you have them sign any NDA or contract? No.

[00:13:32] Sue Bryce |  I don't because, it's just they don't go and share anything, and you're about to sell it anyway. So why do you need an NDA in a contract. Cause once you put it online, you have no control over that. You don't ever don't ever get possessive about your creative energy. Not yours.

[00:13:53] Sue Bryce |  It goes through you. And somebody on the other side of the world is having the exact same idea is you at the same time, and they might actually action on it because it's not yours. And the more you give it away, the more you get and I am living proof of facts. Don't stop giving from that stage. Yeah.

[00:14:16] Sue Bryce |  These assets are really interesting. So to me now, as you look at all these products, you're going to start to see all the on it. And I think that this is really important. Let's make a $100,000. I got given this at 3 o'clock this morning.

[00:14:30] Sue Bryce |  You're welcome. I didn't go back to sleep, but I figured you guys must be important because I did get this at 3 o'clock this morning. And I was like, know what? I think these guys are gonna freak out when they hear this. So something I see in all of you is, you know, we're needy little meat sex and we're creators, then we're always like, ah, validation.

[00:14:50] Sue Bryce |  And am I good enough? So I'm always like, stop trying to be a superstar. Stop trying to be a superstar. And be a superstar. Be one.

[00:15:00] Sue Bryce |  Stop trying to be one. Just be one. I want you to turn on all of your taps, and I want you to own these products with full confidence. And one of the things that I really want you to do is step into this next growth exactly like you've been doing it before. Speak like you have been doing this.

[00:15:21] Sue Bryce |  For years, speak like you make products, have a business, coach, speak like you've been doing it for literally years. That's the best way to do it. Alright. One template. Nikki's cheap little email template made her $19,000 in a year while she slept.

[00:15:40] Sue Bryce |  Market price is $9 to $99 for a downloadable template. If you sell a $49 template on your website right now and you sell 500 of them, you will make $24,500 while you sleep in the next year. While you sleep, if you create a $79 template and you sell a 1000 of them in the next year, you will make 79 $1000 while you sleep. Market price Listen to me, right now, none of the big workshops are selling. Market is flooded.

[00:16:21] Sue Bryce |  So a lot of big workshops out there, 4 100, 600, 800. How do I know if I spend that money? I'm gonna get value. How do I know if I spend the money for a 20 hour course that I have 20 hours for this course? Time are changing my friends.

[00:16:39] Sue Bryce |  Things are moving faster. People want live interaction and really fast, distribution is important, but it's the way we consume the content. The consumption is important. If you give me a long form video on marketing, but I only need 3 important pieces from it, I have to scrub through 90 minutes of marketing to get the information I need. That's why in the assets, you're seeing the printed assets you're seeing the downloadable assets.

[00:17:12] Sue Bryce |  You're seeing everything simplified, templated, because you need to have access to the information or you don't buy the class. Now I have something that a lot of people don't have evidence that I'm a good instructor, evidence that I give value, evidence that I'm gonna change your path because I've changed thousands of paths before you, and you know I'm good. But that's lucky. I've been long in the tooth. I proved myself, and I did that by doing free lives and showed up on those stages where I barely got paid and taught workshop over workshop, and I got the chops.

[00:17:50] Sue Bryce |  And I got and I got really good at it. So I'm selling on a lot of goodwill right now, but you need to understand I'm also plugged into coaches all around the world I know how much money they're making and earning because they tell me, and I mentor them. And I know how much the big ones are earning. Really? No.

[00:18:10] Sue Bryce |  And trust me. No one's out there careening it, guys. Everyone is selling their content no different than you're selling your physical products or your physical service. It's just a digital product. And you sell it no differently.

[00:18:26] Sue Bryce |  You connect it. You value it. You market it. You beta test it. You refine it and then you put it out there and you market it, you take it to market consistently.

[00:18:36] Sue Bryce |  And I'm telling you right now, the big workshops are not selling, but I'm about to put 10 new posing templates on the TPM store under $99. These are hot cakes right now. I can't keep content under $99. Why? Why?

[00:18:57] Sue Bryce |  Think about it. A template is right there. Everything you need is there. You don't have to watch videos. You don't have to waste my time.

[00:19:05] Sue Bryce |  It's there right now. It's categorized, titled, an ebook for $49 on how to email clients. Now this is what I got at 3:30 this morning. That was already written. I'm so sorry.

[00:19:20] Sue Bryce |  I knew I was gonna do that. Ruth? Okay. That was already written. This is what I got at 3 o'clock this morning, because I was like, wow.

[00:19:27] Sue Bryce |  Okay. Let's just break it down. I know a lot of you are like trying to write master classes. I have a very extraordinary trajectory to my career. When I got to the US, I got on creative live, and my trajectory was extraordinary.

[00:19:48] Sue Bryce |  Don't look at my trajectory and be like, mine's not measuring up. Mine was very unique. I broke into a world market at the time with a genre that I had mastered had died. When I stood up on that stage, nobody had seen contemporary glamour. Portrait photographers were not dominating on the the amount of money for four times the work.

[00:20:21] Sue Bryce |  I stood up and said that, and a whole lot of wedding photographers gave up wedding photography. I came onto this market, and I am an anomaly because I was the right girl at the right play at the right time that had a lot of experience and a lot to say. So don't look at that number and say, create something that's gonna get you another $100,002,001,000 this year so that when I see you next year, you can say we just bought our 3rd home We just bought the beach house we've always wanted. We just bought a house with our elder son who's just graduated from college We just freed our generational poverty. We just bought a retirement home We just did this and stand in front of me and tell me that that you did that with your templates, because that's a superstar.

[00:21:18] Sue Bryce |  And I'm not doing any of this to be seen. I have never done any of this to be seen. I'm doing this to disappear. And that means I need to make enough money to disappear so that you never see me again. That's what I want.

[00:21:35] Sue Bryce |  Like, this is not a it it's not a game of thrones. We just help people. We help people because we coaches, and we love it, and we know it all. We just know it all, and we're sparkly people that like to create and shine. That's what we are.

[00:21:50] Sue Bryce |  You might as well admit it. Embrace it, run towards it. A lot of people don't wanna be coaches or authors or anything, and you do. It's okay. You know?

[00:22:01] Sue Bryce |  It's easy. So for me, let can we put this slide up? One template. It's either $9 or it's $99. If you have a very basic template, sell it for $9.

[00:22:12] Sue Bryce |  You could sell 10,000 of them. Trust me. It's unbelievable. Now this is the breakthrough. Okay, wait, before I get to the breakthrough, if you create something for $99 and you sell a 1000 of them, you make a 100 k.

[00:22:26] Sue Bryce |  While you sleep. 70 9, 1265 units. $59 16 94. $19,5263. 28,000 photographers have been through the SBE program.

[00:22:44] Sue Bryce |  It's a big market. It's a big, big market. Now here's the breakthrough. Market price is a really unique thing. My friend used to sell her photos at Market on a Sunday.

[00:22:59] Sue Bryce |  Street market. You'd go along. She would sell her photos for 20 to $59 in Little Met's cellophane wrapped urban landscape. Every week, she would make $1500 cash. This is 20 years ago.

[00:23:13] Sue Bryce |  All the other artists would come in, they'd put up $400 canvases. She'd say they're not gonna be here next week. She said, because you're at a market. You don't sell $400 canvases at a $40 market. When people go to market, they have a an idea of what they're gonna spend at this market, and it's around $40.

[00:23:32] Sue Bryce |  If you found something more special, you might buy it. But the majority of people are walking in to market price. Templates are market price under $99. Visually designed. If you're going to get templates that like from Canva, you have to get the commercial license because you're gonna make money off that template.

[00:23:52] Sue Bryce |  Otherwise, design it yourself. It's a one off fee. It's a 100% profit margin. And a lot of state by state do not charge sales tax for tax for downloadable products. Check.

[00:24:10] Sue Bryce |  Is that achievable? When you look at those numbers, is that achievable? Is that achievable? Could you create a digital product? Tell me.

[00:24:21] Sue Bryce |  Come on. I wanna see this chat move. Tell me if anybody feels uncomfortable about this. It's just a $100,000, just extra. All you have to do is go and create it.

[00:24:31] Sue Bryce |  Still haven't told you what I was given at 3:30 this morning. I bet you It's around one of these verticals. This is the personal brand 8 verticals to build a personal brand according to surprise. If you look at the template idea you have, what template would I sell? What would I sell?

[00:25:02] Sue Bryce |  I want you to first look at my eight verticals and say, which of those ones light you up the most? I guarantee it's one of those. I guarantee you're either like, I'm gonna do a branding one. I'm gonna do a branding ebook because I know I'm gonna I know exactly what I love about branding. I'm gonna do a product 1, product creation.

[00:25:24] Sue Bryce |  I love creating products. I love creating products. Oh, I'm doing mine around money. I'm totally it's so if this is the niche business and the theme is one of those then what is your template? What do you know so well?

[00:25:40] Sue Bryce |  You could create a template right now and sell it on your website and make money while you sleep. Nikki is a natural at writing emails to clients. Everybody keeps saying in the group, what do I say? But what do I say? But what do I say?

[00:25:54] Sue Bryce |  But what do I say in was just like, here, use my emails, and she sold a template with emails. That's it. Where would you put Nikki? Oh, customer service, probably, right, or systems? Systems because she's teaching you how to create a system around email to say the right thing to your clients.

[00:26:13] Sue Bryce |  Think about it. These 8 verticals are international. They're creative verticals. This is my new workshop. I know that you're building 8 verticals in your business.

[00:26:22] Sue Bryce |  You're all business owners. You've already built these verticals. Which ones are strong? Which ones have you mastered? Do you understand now this is entirely achievable?

[00:26:33] Sue Bryce |  Now like I say to all my people, I've been having a lot of conversations, a lot of one on one, a lot of breakthrough conversations about what people are creating, and people just go Lot of people are at that stuck phase. They're getting into their head. I'm an imposter, wawa, and, you know, I I know I know. Shut up and get out of the way is all you can say right now. And you know what?

[00:26:57] Sue Bryce |  How about a little bit of healthy competition? Because there's no competition in the creators room. But just understand that if you're in your ego, you're not in the creators room. You're in your ego. So how about a little competitive ego for the people that stuck in their ego, I'll race you to a 100,000.

[00:27:16] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Take your sweet time. Because right now, that 100,000 is for me, but you, well, you go on just meander up here behind me in my shadow and take sweet time to get to your 100,000, and I'll get to my 100,000 first. And guess what? Me getting to a 100,000 first does not take away from your 100,000 because God does not take away the gifts you ask for.

[00:27:37] Sue Bryce |  You just don't receive them or do anything with them. So get your fanny into gear. And start moving, and I'll raise you to a 100 k. How about that challenge? Alright.

[00:27:50] Sue Bryce |  See? Yeah. Easy. Go to sleep, and you're just gonna wake up, and it'd be like, every day. One day, it's $30.

[00:27:58] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. I got paid $30 to sleep last night. Then it's $300 out. I paid $300 to sleep last night. Then it's 3000.

[00:28:07] Sue Bryce |  And I just got paid 3 thou I don't know about you, but I'm getting paid to sleep. Alright. That was my awakening. I bought this back from last week because my awakening was truly like, oh, yeah. It's around one of those.

[00:28:22] Sue Bryce |  I bet you right now, maybe give me, just a yes or or if you feel like right now, you could choose one of those to create a template in. Okay. Is yours marketing?

[00:28:34] Audience Member |  It's 2 of them systems at work.

[00:28:35] Sue Bryce |  System to marketing? Okay. What's yours? Branding. See, I knew it.

[00:28:40] Sue Bryce |  And and if there's any more, please tell me because I was like, wait a minute. You've all built businesses. If you're creating content to support other people starting a business, you have mastered these. Are there any questions for me?

[00:28:57] Chat Host |  Virginia had a question about her brand strategy workbook. She's been fully customizable. Right now, she's giving it away, but she wants to sell it as a product as well.

[00:29:05] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Don't give away anything you wanna sell. Mhmm. Sell it. Yeah.

[00:29:10] Sue Bryce |  Absolutely. And you could always sell it with like, a live connection video or session?

[00:29:16] Chat Host |  Where would you suggest everyone sell their products?

[00:29:20] Sue Bryce |  Okay. So next week, we're specifically going to build a list. And this is a big one, but before we start talking about actually selling the content. That's gonna go next week. Let's decide what our structures are around what those products are first because let's stay on that week.

[00:29:38] Sue Bryce |  Next week, we're gonna go through marketing, list, and pricing. But you've also all been through the pricing. You know it's personal, and you know it's about money. So that's the one that I really lose my mind. How does a small fish advertise this product to sell that many.

[00:29:54] Sue Bryce |  For example, I have a small community of followers, less than 1000. So, Melanie, when you have a small digital product, and then it's probably a niche. And you can also, like, look at that niche and sort of say, well, This is just a couple of digital products. So let's say that niches also people you coach or people that are in a private group, or people that would book your workshop, you can still offer digital products to those people. They'll buy your workshop and that, and then you'll just keep growing the audience.

[00:30:29] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. My problem is not making the product. It's marketing the product. Everyone tells me that. They say that they're making it, but now they have to market it.

[00:30:39] Sue Bryce |  And a lot of people say what I really need to do is start marketing. That's actually not true. What you need to do is start selling, and you're not selling, and if people are making shit and not selling shit, then they're afraid of money. And I know you're afraid of money. Otherwise, yeah, what has said?

[00:30:57] Sue Bryce |  And then when you stand in front of me, what am I gonna say to you? Do you love it? Can you sell it? Do you love it? Can you sell it?

[00:31:04] Sue Bryce |  So, yes, ultimately, to get an extra 100,000, you would need to sell a $99 product a thousand, you know, times, but you could also keep building your audience around it and These are business systems. They can be for all creatives. They don't have to be specifically for safe photographers, or you're talking to entrepreneurs, creative entrepreneurs. They all need every one of these steps. They all need these.

[00:31:31] Sue Bryce |  And if you do, you, describe these as the 8 verticals of a personal brand, say they are Super Bryce's personal brand workshop, please. And you can create anything you want in any of those verticals. That's just how I teach them and how I see them. I don't see anything about craft, like a PDF, about lighting, that's exactly right, Florence, because people stopped creating craft PDFs. Now on SBE, I have posing, lighting, downloadable, all PDFs I have everything, downloadable.

[00:32:05] Sue Bryce |  It's exactly what I've been doing. All these years is just creating it on my niche and selling it, and there's just not enough of them. And once you've created it, it's on your store, and it's making you money. Even if it made you a $1000, between now and Christmas and you didn't look at it again, you would still get a $1000 more than you have right now, and you could start building on that library and create multiple templates, but it's the building of the list that is the most important, and most of the building in your list is gonna come from your social media. So the 100 k challenge, is this around the verticals we've been building?

[00:32:44] Sue Bryce |  Okay. I said the challenge is a joke, to say, that basically you're competing with me with your fear. So this $100,000 challenge, we can make it a challenge because I love making money, and I really enjoy doing it, and I love selling content. So really what we're trying to do is create a product that we can just focus on selling. So let's get back to creating the products because already people are starting to talk about We're gonna spend a lot of time doing that next week.

[00:33:15] Sue Bryce |  How many templates should you, you are before you start to sell a market? Start with 1. Start selling that. Keep selling it. And then get another one sell that.

[00:33:23] Sue Bryce |  3rd one sell that. 4th one sell that. 5 don't stop selling. If it's good, keep selling it. Bundle them together.

[00:33:29] Sue Bryce |  And then do bundles every sales like Black Friday sale. Oh, you can get every one of my templates for $20 off. Who do I use for customer service? My sweet self and Jen from team gets shit done. She actually runs my customer service portal and email, and I pay her a monthly fee to do so.

[00:33:47] Sue Bryce |  Because she's so awesome. Can you talk about creating a funnel of products like low barrier to entry upsells to a larger investment bigger course? That to me sounds a lot faster path to 100 k. That's next week in building our list. I firmly believe this.

[00:34:02] Sue Bryce |  And truly, Do you remember when we were all doing everybody was doing lead gen videos and you go and give them your email and you do your lead gen video? And then you now have their email to sell to them, this is still 100% the way you build a list. And so I believe now that because content is getting so oversaturated and people are picking and choosing which timeline that they're gonna, you know, get To me, I realized I'm gonna go back to lead capture. So I've just filmed 3 lead capture. 1 for SBE, 1 for content curator, and 1 for the next workshop personal brand.

[00:34:42] Sue Bryce |  Now I'm going to focus on building a list for those 3 workshops, and the lead generator video is packed full of goodness around those 3 subjects, and they all go to the same list, which is converting in sales. And that's still how we're selling. And it's still the best way to sell other than the organic reach you get from your social media. So, yeah, I mean, it's just it's pretty fast. It will start growing.

[00:35:11] Sue Bryce |  So don't worry if it feels like I know that everybody feels like Oh, but I don't have a big audience yet, but you'll get there. You'll get up there. And again, an extra $10,000, I will not complain about. Any questions for me? Podcastors, Avia.

[00:35:31] Sue Bryce |  Let's have a look. Make sure I go through all my notes. Ask me questions, guys. I am here for you. Nope.

[00:35:42] Sue Bryce |  Put me through that.

[00:35:44] Chat Host |  There are a few questions in here about a series of workbooks. So it's like, how do you how do you market a series? How do you create it? Trying to find the right buyers.

[00:35:56] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Look. It's no different. You're just gonna start building your list. You're going to do your beta test.

[00:36:00] Sue Bryce |  You're gonna start getting your clients, and you're gonna start building your database around your products, and then you're gonna start marketing and speaking about all of your products, your brand story, making videos as much as you can, making reels as much as you can, That's why it's really important that you have all of that content mapped out so that you know exactly what your timeline is, what you've learned, and where you're going next That's a big one. Any questions in here? We've got a mic.

[00:36:24] Audience Member |  Quick question. Yeah. So if you've been doing it, but not officially, And now you wanna create a template, but it hasn't so I'm a photographer and I do photography, but it also help business owners that come through my studio. And, like, I even helped somebody open her shop, like, last month, literally, just to caution her tell telling her how I do it. And I'd love put a template together, but how do I market it when I when I have nothing on my social media?

[00:36:51] Sue Bryce |  So you've already done it? You're already doing it? Yeah. Well, if you're already doing here's the thing that I love. You're acting like you're coming out with this thing.

[00:37:01] Sue Bryce |  Like, how do I come out of my social media that I have this product? Like, that's really what you're saying. Right? Although it could just be your face like this new product.

[00:37:15] Audience Member |  Okay.

[00:37:16] Sue Bryce |  I mean, how do you talk about a new product? But if How do you talk about a new product on your social?

[00:37:23] Audience Member |  Or, like, basically, you I I show how excited I am about it. You know?

[00:37:27] Sue Bryce |  So what are you really asking?

[00:37:30] Audience Member |  I'm asking, like, I'm not a business coach per se, and I don't know if that's with the proper term right now because I'm not doing it officially, but how do I come out and be like, oh, I'm doing this business? Come out? Literally.

[00:37:42] Sue Bryce |  How do I come out as a coach? This is the problem that a lot of you are stuck on. If you're already doing it, you are a coach. Offer coaching, you're stuck on the identity on calling yourself something.

[00:37:55] Audience Member |  Yeah. That and that's perfectly. That's exactly it. Yes.

[00:37:59] Sue Bryce |  So if you're afraid to say it Just do it. You can't be a coach. And if you're already coaching, you are a coach. So what's the problem?

[00:38:06] Audience Member |  I don't see any right now. Thank you.

[00:38:09] Sue Bryce |  Because I've gotta shut up and get out of the way. Yeah. So shut up. Get out of the way. Okay.

[00:38:18] Audience Member |  Yeah. Thank you so much.

[00:38:20] Sue Bryce |  Mhmm. Seriously, when you break it down, to steps, what step are you getting stuck on? When it's a step by step plan, when there's 64 steps to create a personal brand, It's gonna be real clear to me where you get stuck, and you don't unlock the next vertical until you power up the vehicle you're on. Because every vertical unlocks the next, and that's exactly how I know what you need when I'm coaching you. Because if I've got 80% of the room stuck on money, what class am I gonna teach next?

[00:38:54] Sue Bryce |  If I've got 80% of you stuck on imposter syndrome, What template will I make next? Now every time I'm coaching somebody, all I'm thinking is I'm watching what you need next. Because where you get stuck is where I'm creating next. When when I see you get stuck, I can find a solution for you, and I can I can just light up a path for you? So the more you get stuck on my steps, the more you give me in systems, The more you show me what's missing from my education, the more you give me ideas around bridging gaps and content, and the more you empower me to create more content for you.

[00:39:38] Sue Bryce |  That's how I do it. It's so obvious to me when people have created a brand, and they've made a product, but they can't sell it yet. I said you're at number 2 of a business. You're at the number 2 vertical of creating a product and selling it. And you will not get to the next level until you lock that in.

[00:40:00] Sue Bryce |  Whatever that product is, most of you have been through that You've already been through it with your physical products or your physical service, and now this is just a new product. So you're coming to this table, like I said to Angie, same view, different altitude. But if you haven't dealt with your money, you're gonna stop right there. And I know in order to get you through, I need to give you coaching, money mindset, money videos, a money book, a money workshop series, a money one on one. It doesn't matter These are all of the verticals everybody is mastering, every one of us in our personal brand.

[00:40:37] Sue Bryce |  So whatever you've mastered is valuable to anybody creating a personal brand. Anybody. It's so incredible to me. Any books on identity shifting? Actually, Alex, I don't know any books on identity.

[00:40:58] Sue Bryce |  Maybe somebody could reach out. I would actually watch self value videos. My power talks talk about identity, finding the self, unfolding the self in a way that I've never read in any other book, and I did that myself. So, yeah. I can't see the questions if they go too high because of the chat.

[00:41:18] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Just Ashanti's I should I should write something. Been viewing this all wrong. I'm a branding specialist in creating templates as a no brainer. Boom.

[00:41:27] Sue Bryce |  That's right. I figured that at 3:30 this morning, I say Why am I being showed $19 products? Why are you showing me $19 products when people want a $10,000,000 brand. And I was like, because 99% of the people here will start with a $19 product or $99 product and make enough money to send their child to college while they sleep. Even if your online template pays for your weekly coffee while you sleep.

[00:42:04] Sue Bryce |  Yes, Angie.

[00:42:06] Audience Member |  So as we're unfolding all of these opportunities and doing the bones, For me, my ADD is coming in again, and I'm struggling to find one to focus on. So I have all of these different

[00:42:18] Sue Bryce |  that if you can't focus on 1, then you're thinking about too many and you're not feeling any. Or you're thinking about the one you should do and not doing the one you know you absolutely should do for you.

[00:42:33] Audience Member |  Okay.

[00:42:34] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Because, You know, procrastination is avoidance. Don't get stuck in avoidance. And also, I would say perfectionism avoidance. It's gotta be perfect.

[00:42:49] Sue Bryce |  It's not gonna it's gotta be perfect. It's never gonna be perfect. You'll never be perfect. I am not perfect. I make big mistakes, and you're just not.

[00:42:59] Sue Bryce |  So you've just gotta go avoidance avoidance avoidance. Yeah. I want you to truly just create something that you know and love doing I, if you're confused about this path, I want you to create one template this week and price it between $9.99 decide what that template's worth, and get all of the assets around it. The description, the title, Who it's for? What does it do?

[00:43:29] Sue Bryce |  How did you get there? How long did it take you to master this? Everything you've learned, all those templates follow the steps, the checklist until that template is ready to sell, get that up, and making money The goal is your first ten units. Then you sell your first 100 units, and then you're looking to sell your next 1000 units. If you launch a product without beta testing it without doing it with people and you just launch it and it's a soft sell and People do this to me all the time.

[00:44:00] Sue Bryce |  They call me, they go, I've got a product on my website. It's sold like 8, and that's it. And I go, cool. What do those eight people say about it? Nothing.

[00:44:12] Sue Bryce |  What does that tell me? 8 people bought this and 8 people have nothing to say about it. Did you reach out to them? No. Did you connect with them?

[00:44:21] Sue Bryce |  No. Did you ask what did you do right? What did you do wrong? No. Did you have a live component where you could connect with them live?

[00:44:30] Sue Bryce |  No. Was it beta tested? No. Okay. So nobody's buying your product because you're not selling it.

[00:44:37] Sue Bryce |  It's not connected because it's not selling, and other people who have bought it are not sharing it, which means it's not good, and it's not connected, So get out of your ego, take it down, and rework it until it is valuable, and people want it. And how do you know that people want it your beta test will tell you. Your beta test will tell you. When somebody says, why isn't it selling? I say it's not connected yet.

[00:45:04] Sue Bryce |  It's not connected to you or it's not connected to the people out there. So you're either connected to the content, but you're not selling it, or you're not connected to the content, and that's why it's not selling because people can feel it. It's true. You connect itself You connect it, you can sell it. If you love it, you can sell the hell out of it.

[00:45:24] Sue Bryce |  Really, really. Yeah. How many pages should a template have? How long is a piece of string? And how much should that piece of string be?

[00:45:37] Sue Bryce |  There are no rules. There are no rules. If I gave you a $9 template and a $99 template, I would think that it would be more value for a 99, but that's not true. I could sell something with a lot less content in it than a lot of people and say that it's more valuable, and it will have more value because it's, you know, my word but it's just comparatively there is no rules. It's just gotta have meat and veg.

[00:46:08] Sue Bryce |  How do you keep pace creating. Like, I gave 14, and counting top lit top topics, and I'm building on it and keeping up with organizing. Well, slow down. You sell one good product at a time. If you have a library of good templates, people might buy 2 or 3, but how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time?

[00:46:30] Sue Bryce |  And you make products one product at a time. Which product do I make first the one that lights you up the most that you think will be the easiest for you to sell because you love it so much. Sometimes I have the impression it's all been done and said, why should people buy my template? Because Oliver, it has been done, and it has been said, and you're not special. That's it.

[00:46:59] Sue Bryce |  It has all been done, and it's all been said. Yeah. But hasn't been done and said in your energy. And for some reason, people will be attracted to your energy who are just like you. And I see me in my audience, and I see people who have been through money struggle because they know that my brand story.

[00:47:25] Sue Bryce |  I see people who have reinvented themselves because they know that's my lived experience. People follow me because they identify with a part of me and my brand story that is a part of them. And it could just be that I'll lead you step by step. Sure. But mostly, you have to like somebody before you buy from them.

[00:47:47] Sue Bryce |  So really what you're doing is if you are your most authentic self, then the people who are authentically a attracted to your energy, we'll find you because like is a likeness, and like attracts like, And so there's part of you and your brand story and the way you deliver and the way you speak. And, you know, like I said, people tell you all the time what they want from you? Do you have a book? Do you have a workshop? You know, do you have this?

[00:48:15] Sue Bryce |  Because they really do tell you, but they also tell you what they love about you. People tell me all the time. It was like he was speaking to me personally, like, just me. And I said that means that you're hearing my story for you and that makes me happy. People say, all the time, you made me believe it's possible.

[00:48:38] Sue Bryce |  Why? Because I did it. Well, you all think little of me that she can do it. I can do it too. That's great.

[00:48:46] Sue Bryce |  That works because you guys fully tell me that, like, on a weekly basis, you make me believe this is possible. And I was like, it was possible for me. And when somebody says, who does she think she is, or who does he think he is? I say, well, who did I think I was? When I was full of shit standing up on the stage saying, I've got it all.

[00:49:08] Sue Bryce |  Who people told me I couldn't do it? And I was like, okay. Those are your limits. Who am I to tell you that you can't do this or tell them that they can't do this? That's a reflection of you.

[00:49:21] Sue Bryce |  It's just a reflection of you. If you are jealous or envious of anybody else or if you are cutting someone down or comparing them all about you, It's all about you, you, you. And if you are doing that, write a list and activate on that list right now, because envy envy is a call to action, NV is a call to write a list of what you want. And when you envy someone else or an envy shows up as criticizing someone else, like, Who do they think they are trying to get on the stage? Well, you're trying to get on the stage.

[00:49:54] Sue Bryce |  Guess what? Still about you. Listen to your judgment of others. I don't have the right to judge a single business that stands in front of me and pays me to mentor them. I have no right to stand in front of someone and say, they'll never make it because I did against the odds, no education, no execution, Born on the wrong side of the tracks?

[00:50:17] Sue Bryce |  Come on, man. I've heard it all. Born in a market gardening town. Let's go when I was fifteen. What?

[00:50:24] Sue Bryce |  What? Tell me this story, walk towards what you want, what you love, be valuable, trust your voice. You know, the other day, I've been putting a lot of content, curated stuff on my photographer, Instagram, and I haven't lost a single follower. But I've been careful about it because I'm like, these guys know I've been teaching for 14 years, Why was I holding back from sharing this workshop? I love this workshop.

[00:50:47] Sue Bryce |  And I was like, oh, I didn't wanna piss people off. I didn't wanna have people leave my audience. And then I was like, wait a minute. If you don't see the value in this class or this class, where you go? I don't care if I have 20,000 followers.

[00:51:01] Sue Bryce |  There's the door. I would like all racists, all bigots, and all people who don't love me and my brand to please leave with love. There's nothing here for you. I want 20,000 people that wanna buy this. I want 20,000 people that I can move their needle.

[00:51:20] Sue Bryce |  No. Wake up every day, and I wanna talk to that 20,000 people, and I want to help them change their lives. And I have goosebumps all over my body because they believe this with every cell in my being. Right? What if you have an idea for a physical product?

[00:51:40] Sue Bryce |  Can't quite see the rest. That hasn't been created yet, like stepping into the painting. Oh, that's exciting. First, reach out to a patent lawyer because then they'll tell you if there's a patent pending, and a lot of the times it is, and go through a patent lawyer. It will cost you around $3000 for a trademark.

[00:51:57] Sue Bryce |  That's what it cost me $3000 for a trademark. You cannot trademark, common words or common phrase Like, I could not trademark self value. It's a common phrase. But if the product can be trademarked, then go to a patent lawyer and talk to them first. Thank, whatever.

[00:52:20] Sue Bryce |  I'm beta testing my retreat next month. Yes. I want more beta tests. Before you beta test, that'll have their will actually next week. We're gonna talk about beta testing.

[00:52:29] Sue Bryce |  So you're actually gonna get a lot more information too before you even start your beta test. Which is awesome. More questions. Any questions in this room? Yes.

[00:52:44] Sue Bryce |  So can you create templates for all businesses? Yes. I'm not talking to photographers. I will use photography language a lot in this workshop. But not all the people in this room are photographers and not all the people that have bought this workshop are photographers.

[00:52:58] Sue Bryce |  They are creative, solid printers who own a personal brand. That's pretty much who I create content for. In fact, I identified after putting 28,000 people through Subrise Education. That that market was not big enough for me. I wanted to teach business so I could have a bigger audience.

[00:53:21] Sue Bryce |  Because photo was a small international audience. Does anyone know what program used if people commit, comment, a specific word on a social media post? Yes. I do know that. It's called

[00:53:32] Audience Member |  Many chat.

[00:53:33] Sue Bryce |  Many. Many chat. Yeah. Aaron just did it on my Instagram. It's called Many Chat.

[00:53:40] Sue Bryce |  And how you do it is he got my Instagram, he got a code, and he just went and put it. He knew how to do it. He stepped through the whole thing. I gave him my phone. He came back.

[00:53:50] Sue Bryce |  Now I can do the active words on Instagram, which brings So a lot of people are saying, comments or DM with a comment photo to get my book, but they don't realize that just sending a DM with the word photo. If you activate ManyChat on your Instagram account and you say, comment photo, then it automatically sent answers that and sends a DM. It's automatic. Yeah. I don't know how much it costs, but I am starting to use it.

[00:54:21] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. 15 a month. Thank you. Sue, you're on fire. Thank you, Dorena.

[00:54:29] Sue Bryce |  I beta test my new course for the webinar for creative solopreneurs with my product, a workbook, doing the homework, and creating in real time excellence. Excellent. Excellent. Alright. If there's no more questions, I'm gonna go, so ask me questions about structure.

[00:54:48] Sue Bryce |  Because I have said it all today, and now I'm just answering no more questions in here. Oh, come on. Don't be scared. I'm not gonna get make you do a hot seat.

[00:55:00] Audience Member |  So I know, I got, like, a little tingly feeling when you talked about what would I produce? And I already produced it, but I've been giving it away for free. So would you suggest that I do an enhancement or just put a dollar sign on the one given by Just

[00:55:14] Sue Bryce |  put a dollar sign on it.

[00:55:16] Audience Member |  Got it.

[00:55:16] Sue Bryce |  Yeah. Just dollar sign. And if anybody says, do you not do that anymore? Say, oh, I was just beta testing it now. It's a fully fledged program, or now it's a now it's a product.

[00:55:27] Sue Bryce |  Yes. I was beta testing. Now it's a product. Yeah. Welcome to my beta test.

[00:55:31] Sue Bryce |  Obviously, we're here to develop this product together. And what I really want is to move your needle. So remember, no matter what you're doing in your beta test, you're there to move their needle and prove that the content you have, you are not there to get validation that your content is good enough. You're there to actually change somebody's path. If you focus on that, single thing, you will change somebody's path.

[00:55:56] Sue Bryce |  Because changing one person's business is louder on social media than anything else you can do. Really, really cool. Should we beta test every product? I would like you to beta test every product, because if you had Okay. Here's another way to beta test that's not putting out a call for beta testers.

[00:56:17] Sue Bryce |  Another way you could do it too is You could have a creative sounding board. Like, let's say I have Nicky, Aaron, George, maybe Colin, Jason. And I put it out to my creative board, and I'm like, like a round table to get their feedback. But ultimately, if you put your product out there, people are going to tell you it's good, or they'll go, oh, maybe you could change this. And because they're not using it, and it hasn't changed their business, you're just gonna be like, you're you're giving me feedback that is like kind of irrelevant.

[00:56:56] Sue Bryce |  But if you're in business and you're in the same business as me and I'm walking you through transforming a vertical in your business or part of a vertical or something that will significantly change your income that's gonna give me quantifiable steps like I put this system in Now I have eight times more bookings. I created this template, and now I help people convert four times faster. You know, you're going to get, like, a quantifiable result, but because you're working with someone, you not only get the quantifiable result, you get their testimonial around it. And then it's like, my name's Margaret. I did this workshop.

[00:57:33] Sue Bryce |  I've created $75,000 in digital products over the next year, over the following year, and I make money while I sleep. That is the best testimonial I could have under content curator. So anybody wants to get to 75,000 I'll put you on front of my website. Right? That's what you want.

[00:57:53] Sue Bryce |  You want somebody that is at changing and doing something. And if you look at your mentees and you think, damn, I need to charge more because they're making more money, then what does that tell you? Because when you see evidence that what you're giving is supported and works, you see dollars. Whatever your day rate is at your highest peak, your full energy self, whatever that is, whether you're a dentist, a painter. It doesn't matter.

[00:58:30] Sue Bryce |  A photographer, a designer. Whatever your day rate is, your mentoring should match that. Because why would I spend the day making your life better for cheaper than what I can earn just doing it myself? And if I'm gonna teach you how to fish, then I wanna make sure that I'm compensated for that. So it's a really interesting idea that that content can just go away from you, and you don't have to be responsible for it.

[00:59:02] Sue Bryce |  But if you stay connected to it, and you follow the people who follow it and learn from it and grow from it, you can truly build an amazing foundation. You know, I don't, The question is, is 3 minutes a slide on a presentation in average? No. Again, how long is a piece of string? If you talk for 40 minutes, you can break it into 3:20 minute segments.

[00:59:30] Sue Bryce |  It depends what the content structure is. Like, let's say you're talking about self development, but the first 20 minutes is self confidence. The second 20 minutes is executing. The third one is maybe growing to the next step. You've kind of defined the time around it, but there's no rule.

[00:59:50] Sue Bryce |  And that's why when I say, to people, when I look at it, they go, cool. Are we what are we working with here? Are we talking days, weeks, months, vertical steps, titles, segments, videos, chapters, slides? What are we talking here? Because time, time, time, time, how long is your talk?

[01:00:10] Sue Bryce |  And if you have a 90 minute talk and you have 30 bullets, then you have to summarize in 3. It's really how you divide it more than how you construct it. Did you answer the platforms about what? Oh, okay. So what, platforms to sell on?

[01:00:29] Sue Bryce |  Right now, in the digital world, all industries have platforms that have libraries that license content. TPM is looking for licensing content. They're not looking for future instructors. They're over it. Future instructors are like, I'm ready to be picked And then you go, cool.

[01:00:48] Sue Bryce |  Send me all of your descriptions and your titles and you're a speaker, assets, and they don't have any. So I'm interested in people that are doing it. So if you've filmed it and it's got good sound and good content and you wanna put it forward to be licensed, That's how you get on other platforms. Reach out to any online platform and say, do you license content, what is your licensing contract, and what is the percentage you offer Are you interested in seeing content in this industry to license it as mine? And if they say yes, You can make them sign an NDA if you want to, but for me, I've never had to sign an NDA instructor send me their content all the time.

[01:01:29] Sue Bryce |  So I don't steal content. But again, if you wanna do it properly, then you should actually sign an EDA. But the ultimate chance would be to sell through through a license. Otherwise, you're going to create a store, and you're going to sell through your own personal brand and your own store. Yeah.

[01:01:48] Sue Bryce |  That's a great point. I'm at I was at 6000 a day as a wedding photographer. Yeah, Kate. But you know, it didn't take you one day to shoot a wedding. It took you 40 hours.

[01:01:58] Sue Bryce |  So you're 6 k a week, sister. You're talking to a portrait photographer. I'm like, yeah. Wedding photographers. It's it's only a matter of time before you come to the dark side.

[01:02:13] Sue Bryce |  It's only a matter of time till you find me. Okay. Go down a little bit more. No. Sorry.

[01:02:20] Sue Bryce |  Up a little bit more, I mean. Down, down, down, and keep going up. Nope. All the way. All the way.

[01:02:26] Sue Bryce |  Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

[01:02:28] Sue Bryce |  Keep going. I'm very interested in working with people. Oh, you just went, yeah, to wish to leave their employment in into the world. Oh, Melody. Okay.

[01:02:36] Sue Bryce |  The in between. Call it the in between, and nobody else can call it that because that's Melanie. It really is the in between. One of the biggest questions I've ever got coaching people in business was when do I know I'm ready to jump from a full time employment? And I would love it if people said, I'm ready to jump.

[01:02:57] Sue Bryce |  I have this much money. I have this much saved. I've already started my business. Now the energy is just I'm working part time, but that's not what happens because you're creatives. So you're somewhere in the world of I hate my life and I can't do this job anymore, and I can't breathe or exist, and I need to burn everything down so I can spend the next 3 years dragging myself through creating a personal brand.

[01:03:28] Sue Bryce |  In order to get the same amount of money, I'm currently getting on my wage but working four times harder. Right? That's pretty much what we do. So, yeah, call it the in between. And say, let me guide you on that big jump from the job you hate to the life that is yours in the future.

[01:03:46] Sue Bryce |  Once you get through your money shed, learn how our makeup product and build a brand around your name. Welcome to self doubt. That literally is all we're doing, and it's so easy once you start because, I mean, once you start, you're just gonna get you know, stuck along the way. It's really what it is. I'm really scared now.

[01:04:09] Sue Bryce |  You should be. Keeps you going. Scared makes you hungry, scared gives you adrenaline, scared makes you work harder, scared makes you think more about what you're doing, scared makes you be a little bit more prepared than everybody else in the room. And I tell you something, there's merit to having low self value too. Because I came into the stage with low self value, and I outworked everybody on each stage to get up there, And then I gave more on that stage than everybody else was giving.

[01:04:41] Sue Bryce |  So to me, it was like, I I had to give more because I didn't feel worthy of being up there. So maybe the fact that I didn't feel worthy of being in front of you because of my lack of education and my my lack of self value. I would have given less, but instead, I gave more and more and more. And maybe I did that for that very reason. But now that I value myself, guess what?

[01:05:05] Sue Bryce |  My courses are the same price, and my self valuers can considerably higher because it's not about more money. It's about more people because we free everyone We free people. And when you free them, you teach them how to fish, man, and then they make money, and then they're free. And that's all I want. Is for you to be free, to be financially free, to be I want you to wake up and say, I don't work.

[01:05:32] Sue Bryce |  I create I get paid to create. What are you creating today? Whatever the hell I want. That's freedom. Money is freedom, and it gives you more of things you want with the people that you love being with.

[01:05:47] Sue Bryce |  So to me, it is just like, that is the joy my courses don't get more expensive. They just get more valuable because that's it. I just wanna give more value, and I want everyone to know what it feels like to make a $100,000 more. Or a $1,000,000 more. We're just $10,000 more this year because then you've paid for this class, haven't you?

[01:06:13] Sue Bryce |  And then you're gonna tell everybody. I did super ice this content curator class and made an extra $20 this year while I sleep. I can't ask for better than that. I realized if I was gonna be the best instructor on every stage, I had to have the best students. It didn't matter how good I was, how pretty I was.

[01:06:34] Sue Bryce |  It didn't matter how wealthy I said I was, or or even how technically brilliant I said I was. If I couldn't make you guys do what I was doing, then I'm not good at educating. And I learned that So all I ever did was showed you guys quantifiable steps of my students. And every single time you saw yourself, You saw yourself in that indigenous woman, in that woman of color, in that man who came from Co that just bought a second house for his family. He told me that at WPPI, and he he was like, how could I own 2 houses?

[01:07:09] Sue Bryce |  And I was like, because you've done the work. And, like, that's where you find your people. That's why you find your people, Oliver, because those are your people, the people that have had the same story as you, and they're on the same path, and they see it, and it's freedom. And that's what it is. And make no mistake about it.

[01:07:26] Sue Bryce |  So it's not about all I have to do is know every single time that I create something, I know it has value. And then I'm gonna put that value out into the world, and I'm going to change as many paths as I can. You know? That is just so important. Right.

[01:07:46] Sue Bryce |  Technical SEO. How do we honor SEO when building our personal brand? For example, showing my portrait photography and selling coaching products on the same page or separating websites. I understand. Melanie, the majority of people coming to your photography website are other photographers.

[01:08:03] Sue Bryce |  I'd say what? 80 5 percent of the traffic that you get going through your photo website are other photographers comparing themselves to you stealing your brand words, copying your images. That's what they all do. That's what we all do to each other as we're building our own brands. So when you you're not confusing anybody, you're a photographer, and there should be a tab on your website that says, for photographers, and they click that and go into a different portal, or you're gonna create a list just for photographers next week, start doing that, and speak to them on your weekly monthly blog newsletter.

[01:08:41] Sue Bryce |  I have to make you believe this can be done And you know it can. Most of you have already built your first brand under my mentoring. So many of you have. I'm not teaching you how to start a new business. You've already been through that.

[01:09:02] Sue Bryce |  I'm not teaching you how to break new ground. You've already been through that. If anybody says to me, nobody will spend that money in my town. I'm just gonna kick them out of the group. I'm not interested.

[01:09:19] Sue Bryce |  I'm like, oh, you're in the wrong group. Where you go? You can come back when you sort yourself out. This is it. You're making products.

[01:09:27] Sue Bryce |  Let's get excited by them. Let's make a $79 product and make a few $1000. It's what you're doing. You're not curing cancer. Have fun.

[01:09:40] Sue Bryce |  But you'll you'll curators, creators, creatives, go and create something for me, and make it so good you wanna sell it and then make money doing it. And if you're stuck in the how or the what or the who, you're not in the creator's room. Because there's no hell, what or who in the creator's room. That's the ego room. It's that simple.

[01:10:05] Sue Bryce |  Make products sell them. So this last kind of month, I looked at my Instagram and I was like, oh, I teach content curator. I teach photo. I teach personal brand, and I teach self value. And now I just have to own all of that on that one brand, and I don't mind if people leave.

[01:10:27] Sue Bryce |  It's okay. I want the people who want help with this. And this, in money, in self employment, and thriving, and I always find my people. So as soon as your energy is real, you will be attracting your people. It's so amazing when that happens.

[01:10:57] Sue Bryce |  So for the create oh, yeah. Well, you could say instead of 4 photographers on your tab, you could say for startup creative business owners or I love solopreneurs, and I'm using solopreneurs for the tagline for personal brand because I specifically love monetizing creatives and teaching solo brands, how to build personal brands, sorry, teach solo produce, how to build personal brands. That's my 3 by 3 for sure. It just rolls off my tongue. I'm like, Easy peasy.

[01:11:38] Sue Bryce |  I don't know what that means.

[01:11:41] Chat Host |  I think he's looking for a List of resources for the back end for anything that they're selling if you if you provide a platform or a back end resource page for them.

[01:11:54] Sue Bryce |  I still didn't understand the question. Expand on the question, Natasha. Any more questions before I go? I've got 4 minutes. It's 111.

[01:12:07] Sue Bryce |  Any more questions in this wonderful room? Yeah. I very much enjoyed this audience. They, hey, keep coming back every week. And, we've been hanging out today.

[01:12:16] Sue Bryce |  I'm not hanging out. I'm going early because I'm actually catching a flight this afternoon. My best friend is here. And she's in the audience, and she's never ever seen me do a broadcast or speak on stage before. And we're going back to LA together, and then I'm putting her on a into New Zealand tonight.

[01:12:33] Sue Bryce |  Would you believe that? And I'm staying in LA for the weekend. So if there's no other questions, I'm gonna say thank you. Love you wanna leave you. Next week, I do definitely shake some stuff up because they talk about pricing.

[01:12:47] Sue Bryce |  The coaching is gonna be all about building an audience, building a list, building an audience, building a list, building an audience, building a list. Next week, I talk about coaching. And for some reason, on the video that you're that you'll get on Sunday, I think I was quite I think I was quite emotional. You know, it's my typical you can do this kind of speech. But now I'm getting to the part where I have enjoyed watching you all come to acceptance that in order to create more products, you have to expand that identity.

[01:13:24] Sue Bryce |  That's the bit that I have enjoyed the most. Watching you all go through it. So if I big picture SBE, Subrise Education, is the business that I built in 2015, that had 28,000 photographers, and it's an online subscription platform and library. And I just realized with that sort of, that entire, platform. Where was I going with that?

[01:13:53] Sue Bryce |  What was I trying to hit home for you? No. Sorry. What did

[01:13:59] Audience Member |  cremations?

[01:13:59] Audience Member |  No. No.

[01:14:00] Sue Bryce |  Damn. I lost my

[01:14:03] Chat Host |  track. Room?

[01:14:06] Sue Bryce |  Oh, yes. If I look at the big picture of SBA, when people first come into the group and if any, and I do have a lot photographers in this group. So sorry if you're not a photographer, but we have a private Facebook group. When they first come in, it's just all validation. First, they validate money.

[01:14:22] Sue Bryce |  Right? No one will spend less, not in my town. I'm not my client, ma, ma, ma, then they validate themselves. Am I good enough? Am I am I?

[01:14:31] Sue Bryce |  Am I? It's the same path for everybody. I've watched it for 14 years. And the first thing first thing people do is tell you it won't work. And it's like, oh, pretty think it pretty much does.

[01:14:45] Sue Bryce |  Oh, but it worked for you. So then you convert people and then you're just working for these people, Yeah. But that won't work for me because I'm different than these people. And then they tell me, are they good enough to do it? And they go, well, are you good enough to do it?

[01:14:59] Sue Bryce |  You're the only one can answer that question. Are you good enough to serve someone else? And it's still just validation validation validation validation. So when I hear it, I know because it doesn't sound like authenticity. So when people are like, I really wanna be called a speaker I've been a speaker for 10 years, and I just and you can see the way people are doing it instead of like, I love speaking.

[01:15:26] Sue Bryce |  Period. You don't have to tell me anything else? I was I started being a professional speaker in 2010, but for 53 years, I have knocked out 15,000 words a day. I've mastered speaking. I talk underwater.

[01:15:47] Sue Bryce |  People tell me to shut up and go away. Spend most of my young life. Been told I talk too much. I don't need validation to be a speaker. Man, I'm a motor mouth.

[01:16:00] Sue Bryce |  What I needed was to believe that what came out of my mouth had value. That's all. And after being told that I talk too much my whole life, how ironic that I get paid to speak now. I said to my mom one day, people pay to listen to me. People want to be me, mom, and she cracked her laughing.

[01:16:23] Sue Bryce |  And I was like, no. It's such a nice change from shut up, motor mouth, Good lord. Give us a break, but it is my thing. And it's like, it was my shame too for a while, and then it was my superpower. So you don't need permission, and you don't need validation.

[01:16:41] Sue Bryce |  And you don't need to tell me you've already been doing it. I told you you're already doing it. That's why it's your superpower. It's right of you, you've already been doing it. You just don't think it's valuable yet.

[01:16:51] Sue Bryce |  You just don't see that it's valuable yet, and you haven't started selling it. So you're already doing it. Go and be valuable and sell it. You can take me in school, You can, and I'll see you Sunday for next round of video. I'll see you next Thursday for coaching.

[01:17:07] Sue Bryce |  You guys are doing great. Don't stop now. And keep talking to me in the group and keep asking me questions so I can help you take steps. And please, I hope this hit home today. I truly hope that one template comes out of all of you, and that you get your theme and your subject for it, decide what it's worth, create it.

[01:17:27] Sue Bryce |  And if you've got 3 or 4 templates, excellence. Let's get the one up first and start selling that. And when you have evidence that you're selling, I want those numbers. I love it when you guys take photos of the coaching and tag me on Instagram. I share everything.

[01:17:41] Sue Bryce |  I love it when Mitsy takes photos of me when she's watching because she does it creatively. They're always in black and white and have really interesting fun things. And because most of you are, I don't know, photographers, maybe you could get creative with my mug shots. Help a sister out, would you? Help an old sister out.

[01:18:03] Sue Bryce |  I love it when you guys share. I my business is growing, and I'm now working with Super eyes to do content curator to get to the next level. My brand is growing. My personal brand is going growing. I'm working with my mentor more sharing share it with me.

[01:18:20] Sue Bryce |  I love it when you share it with me, and it's a great segue into telling your clients I'm brand brand development its next level after 8 years in business, it's time to go to the next step I grow further. It's okay to talk about growth. Just don't say coming soon. Just say I'm growing. This is what I'm doing.

[01:18:40] Sue Bryce |  This is what I'm learning. This is what I'm developing. This is where I'm at. This is what I do. This is what I love.

[01:18:46] Sue Bryce |  And, again, you don't need validation. Just tell me what you love and why you love doing it. That is really all of the, validation I need for you to get up on stage. Honestly, it was all of the qualification that I had get up on stage and look where I ended up. See you next week.
