Coaching Week 5 - About Page and Beyond

[00:00:00] Sue Bryce | Oh, we got a fun crowd today, guys. We're having fun here already. I've been shaming everybody here, all morning, so I can't wait to do you next. Oh, super fun. Where is my clicker?

[00:00:13] Sue Bryce | Oh my goodness. I won't get far without that. Today, it's oh, let me have a chat. I haven't quite got the chat on there, but hi to everyone out there. Tell us where you're coming in from.

[00:00:23] Sue Bryce | As usual, I have my in person audience today, which is so awesome that I get to chat these guys every day, so I'll just wait for that chat. And our subject today is let's elevate you. It's time. It's time to elevate you. Oh.

[00:00:39] Sue Bryce | I just asked everybody in this room if they would open their about page. On their website. And show it to me. Natalie, when I printed mine and everyone was like, goody good. They didn't know that's what I was gonna talk about today, that I was gonna talk about about pages, but Natalie did print hers, and here it is.

[00:01:04] Sue Bryce | So I just said to everybody, I want you to open your about page, and I want you to show it to me, because I guarantee your about page is a photograph of you with a whole lot of text. And we are 99% accurate. We have 99% of the people sitting in front of me right now have one photo on there about page with a whole lot of text except Joe. Joe had a whole lot of ticks without a photograph of her. She's our only anomaly today.

[00:01:40] Sue Bryce | I just said to Joe, I'm about to call you out And this is a beautiful printed example from Natalie who didn't even know I was gonna be doing this today of a a bell page with a photograph of her and a hollow text. Now I went around to every single person in this room and looked their About page, and we all giggled about our photo and a whole lot of text. And guess what,

[00:02:02] Jen | mine also is a photo with a whole lot of text. So on Monday, I called

[00:02:02] Sue Bryce | Jen, and I said, What if we reinvented what an about page was? Hear me out. I need to hear online. Is any are they online yet? Are they hearing it?

[00:02:20] Sue Bryce | It's anybody out there. Got a about page that is not just a photograph or no

[00:02:23] Jen | photograph, and a whole lot of text about themselves, nobody reads it. And you pulled yourself apart

[00:02:23] Sue Bryce | writing it. Like you were putting your guts and glory out there

[00:02:41] Jen | for everybody, and nobody's gonna read it. Alright?

[00:02:41] Sue Bryce | So I looked at that, but When I wanna know something about you, I'm gonna go to your social media. Once I go to your social media, I know the difference between you're posting about a client, you're posting work, you're posting this, you're posting that, but when I see you appear on your social media, I that's where I start to learn about you. Right? Now we've lost that. We've lost that constant social media connection and who I am on social

[00:03:15] Jen | media constantly putting it out there, who I

[00:03:15] Sue Bryce | am, who I am, who I am, And so now we've gotta go back to our websites, and let's think about how we can change our about page, because in all honesty, we're not promoting ourselves, and we're a personal brand. So if putting yourself

[00:03:35] Jen | out there is so hard, why don't we actually curate a page that's just about us? Why don't we actually really sit down today and work out what are the the 8 best things about

[00:03:40] Sue Bryce | me? And create, like, an adult page

[00:03:51] Jen | that slash a sales page that has business story or brand story. It has a narrative. It's like a resume.

[00:04:05] Sue Bryce | Of your past, if that's relevant, and I have got so much information for that infographic, that brands during that business story, I started to create an infographic. Nobody wants to read 10 paragraphs of boring texts that

[00:04:22] Jen | is probably constructed on chat. And the worst part about it is we're

[00:04:22] Sue Bryce | putting that out there and nobody's connecting to us. So I instantly went to what I know about sales pages, and I instantly know that when you create a sales page, there's an anatomy of a sales page, like it starts off with the problem, and you solve the problem, and this is what I'm selling, and you go through it. And so basically

[00:04:49] Jen | it's really a sales page, but this is an about page, and it's

[00:04:49] Sue Bryce | about you. And I believe that we should reinvent this. Because it would only take right now I'm going to design mine today. I'm designing mine with you, and you can design yours with me, because here's the thing, once I put that out there, I almost, at the bottom of the design, ask gen to create a button that said, share this page with a friend, because I thought, how often will you get to a page like this and go, oh my god, look at her about page, like, oh, I'm so jealous, send it to a friend, like, yes, share it. Like, I actually want it to be shared.

[00:05:30] Sue Bryce | So I said to Jen, can you create a button that's just like, share this page with a friend? She's like, yeah, it's easy. And I was like, because even just the share with a friend button would make me go, I'm gonna share that with a friend and email it to her, or text it to her straight away, it would make me want to do it. So I really sat down, and I thought this, if I'm a personal brand, then I am the brand. No more hiding, right?

[00:05:54] Sue Bryce | So let's go to that about page and put ourselves in this brand, and

[00:05:58] Jen | let's really put ourselves in this brand. So if I'm designing my about

[00:05:58] Sue Bryce | page, this is how I design any websites or any designs, I draw them like this. Right? And I'm sure all the

[00:06:15] Jen | people that get to work with me are like, cool. She sees him pictures. I do. I see him pictures.

[00:06:15] Sue Bryce | I would rather draw this out in a explain it to somebody visually, then try to explain

[00:06:27] Jen | it how I want the design. Now, I'm not holding an end genosis when she designs for me.

[00:06:28] Melissa | I'm not holding to

[00:06:36] Sue Bryce | boxes. Like, I'm not like, this has to be there, and it has to be in a box. I'm just giving her a basic visual representation of what my mind is thinking for this page. I was thinking a beautiful photograph of me, notice how I make myself glam. My lashes on.

[00:06:55] Sue Bryce | Yeah. I'm thinking my 3 by 3 would be over that picture with a beautiful, and this could even be motion, this could even be a little clip playing in the background. Straight away, you're going to be just like, boom, get to my about page. There's going to be some videos, some movement. I saw a couple of people in the chat say that they have videos, are your videos full page, or are they played So right about there, you'd get me and you'd get my 3 by 3.

[00:07:22] Sue Bryce | And if you did not wanna go any further, this is still more dynamic than anything anybody in this room showed me. So straight away, I'm gonna get more attention, right? So that's it there. My next page now listen to this. I have a big story to tell about mastering my craft for 12 years.

[00:07:40] Sue Bryce | I have a big story to tell around building my business, and then I have a big story to tell around personal brand, and then I have a big story to tell around building an an 8 figure business. So each one of these infographics actually are relevant.

[00:07:52] Jen | The narrative is

[00:07:52] Sue Bryce | relevant to what I teach now Otherwise, why would I put my history of business on my about page? So straight away, people see my about page and go, but I haven't been in business as long as you. I'm not telling you to do this, I'm telling you to put what the relevant narrative to you is. Okay. So if you're a new designer and you're just starting out and you don't have, like, all of these years of infographics, then your narrative might be why you do this, and why you created a business around this, but it has to be a narrative around you, and you want this narrative to be the one that flows.

[00:08:38] Sue Bryce | Now there's lots of ways to do this. It doesn't have to be text, you can create a video that tells your brand story. Just like they do on Instagram, where you're watching a vertical video, and they're on Instagram saying we found this puppy, and it's showing videos, and there's words, and it's just so simple. It's just a slideshow, but we're captivated. It's changing.

[00:08:58] Sue Bryce | The words are changing. It does not have to be an expensive video. So I started to write out all of the really cool sort of lessons that I had with each of these infographics. And it occurred to me that I would speak that narrative in the video, that I would not put, you know, 5 big paragraphs of information. In fact, they can click each one of these infographic and get all the information from that year that they need, again, is it relevant to

[00:09:27] Jen | my story, if it's not relevant to my story?

[00:09:27] Sue Bryce | Now I do this thing called positioning, alright? Positioning. It's so incredible. I do it when I go networking with my wing man, that's positioning, because if a wing man is over there talking about me and going, oh my gosh, have you met Subrise? They've just positioned me as being someone important.

[00:09:53] Sue Bryce | I do the same for them, my position people in my business by saying, this is my Melissa, my incredible host, you know, she is blah, blah, blah, and the cool part about that is, oh, sorry, the light. The cool part about that is I elevate Melissa Melissa elevates me.

[00:10:09] Jen | We're constantly elevating, which is positioning. So the cool part about positioning yourself is whatever

[00:10:09] Sue Bryce | narrative you choose is how you position yourself, For instance, if you're a designer and you want to talk about design, you're talking to other designers. If you want to talk about small business, you're talking to small business owners. Whoever you're speaking to is the narrative that is relevant to your story that positions you consistently as being the top of your field or an expert in your field. Now once you get to these narrative, these like infographics, and I'm gonna do them like infographics, but you're gonna click over it and it's gonna pop up and you actually built a business, made a $1,000,000 sold, and Woah, each step is like a wow, wow, wow, wow, and there'll be imagery behind as well, or plain because I put an image there. My third page is an invitation.

[00:10:59] Sue Bryce | The invitation is really just it's very short. It's actually 3 beautiful paragraphs where I invite people, and to basically, I invite people to come and work with me. It's it's basically my why. Okay? It's so my why, and it's small, and it's and it's poignant to you.

[00:11:20] Sue Bryce | It's actually more about you than it is about me, alright? Then I thought this allows for a beautiful big video, and this video going to be called the Subrice experience. What is the Subrice experience? Now, what is

[00:11:31] Jen | your experience? Put your name in there.

[00:11:42] Sue Bryce | So if you look at this, you get me, you get my 3 by 3, there's an infographic that you can choose to take as much as you want, you can just see it for, oh, look at all those business chops, or you can go, oh, look at that. Oh, I want to hit that. Oh, wow! And every single narrative has a reason why I teach business, why I mastered my craft, how I

[00:12:01] Jen | learned selling, how I learned money, everything is relevant to me that positions me as a speaker and a

[00:12:09] Sue Bryce | teach Once I get to the Subrise experience, I have to really consider what that's gonna be. Now, if I made this page here, but I didn't have this video yet or this video yet, that would still be fine. That's just gonna make this page even better. Right about now I would put testimonials, even though they're also on the website, if they're really relevant, and I'm gonna position myself in the testimonials. For starters, if I want business testimonials, I'm gonna make sure people say things like she changed my business, right?

[00:12:42] Sue Bryce | Cause it positions me in the right way. Every word on this page has to position you and bring value to you and the people reading it. So don't repeat, don't say the same word don't use the same adjectives. Like, keep it so clean and simple, and I've got some really cool tips for you. Hang on.

[00:13:03] Sue Bryce | Let me just work through these because I'm not looking at my slides. So an about page can also be hidden. A sales page does not have to be on your menu, which means if you're directly selling to people and you want to create a beautiful dynamic sales page, but you don't want that sales page to be on your website, the only people that can access it are people with a link, because you don't make that link live. The same with this about page, when you're first building it, if you feel shy about it, you cannot put it out there, but I want you to put it out there, and you have to really ask yourself why you're not putting it out there. Okay.

[00:13:37] Sue Bryce | So some social proof that's relevant again to the positioning, the experience, the narrative, the story, and you. We always have joined, joined the VIP list, joined the wait list, join the workshop, you know, we have follow, we have social media, and then at the bottom, I'm gonna have my speaker real. Yesterday, we're gonna learn about speaker reels, and we're gonna learn about creating talks for networking, because that's my wheelhouse. And at the very bottom of this, I want my speaker real here, will be contact information to book me as a speaker. And this is this will be the Subrise Sales page, and I'm gonna make it all about me, and I'm gonna make it delicious, and vid and just video rich, and I'm gonna make it photo rich, and I'm gonna make it a

[00:14:24] Jen | little bit of a journey. You know, when I first see

[00:14:24] Sue Bryce | somebody online that interests me, whether it's on social media or on a stage or on a video, the first thing I do is I go to learn more about them. Like, I want to know more about her. And what do I do when I go to a website and I see an over retouched photo of you that does not necessarily look exactly like you? Very static. Maybe not even smiling.

[00:15:02] Jen | And then I read this very beige watered down

[00:15:02] Sue Bryce | description of you, and you're the personal brand. So I started to Google, and I could not, even find an interesting about page for anyone. I know there will be some brilliant ones out there, and I'm sure people have already created workshops around it. Like, content is everywhere. And content often, I will conceptualize something, and I know I've conceptualized it because I woke up in the morning.

[00:15:41] Sue Bryce | It was there. I downloaded it, and then I activated it, and someone in the other side of the world has activated the same thing. Because I believe that creativity comes to you, and it comes through you. I don't believe it's yours, So, yes, I've seen people create simultaneously on the other side of the world, similar things. It doesn't matter.

[00:16:02] Sue Bryce | Creativity is just creativity. And it's something that made me realize we're not even on our websites, We're hiding in everywhere, and then we're giving people this very static view of us in one photograph.

[00:16:16] Jen | And I'm supposed to like you enough to buy from you.

[00:16:17] Sue Bryce | Now if you are insecure with how you look, That photograph is not going to be authentic. It's gonna be retouched. It's gonna be it's just not gonna it's gonna be a different version of you, and it's not you. And people have to fall in love with you in order to spend money with you. They have to like you in trust you, so now it's time to really look at what is me, who is the me that's going on this brand?

[00:16:47] Sue Bryce | That everyone's like, I like that dude, I like that chick, and I wanna follow them. So now it's time. You also have creative free range, And one of the things I don't want you to do is I am limited by creativity sometimes, because I'm really creative, but there's always people way more creative than me that inspire me, but I don't want you just to go and draw a rectangle with 5 boxes and copy that flow because I know that's but you just told us to do it, and they did. Sometimes when you teach something, you have to teach it loosely, because if you teach it too specifically, you only take the specific lesson in it, and it's it's like you take it as complete logic and truth, but it's like, yes, it's creative free range, but you could just stay with the video at the top and the 3 by 3 over the top and let the video have a narrative. But the time has come to actually be there.

[00:17:56] Sue Bryce | And also, you're all really likable people in this room. The goal is to to be likable online so that people can see the real you because they're like, I like her, and I want her to be my designer. You know? Alright. Any questions?

[00:18:14] Sue Bryce | Ask me questions? Like I need water today. Alright. Here's a pro tip, like I always say squirrel. Did you know The 14 words is the perfect length for a sentence for people to read comfortably.

[00:18:27] Sue Bryce | That sentence

[00:18:27] Jen | has 14 words.

[00:18:28] Sue Bryce | So if you go to chat

[00:18:28] Jen | and say curate marketing

[00:18:28] Sue Bryce | content with my sentences, being between 1417 words for your 3 by 3, make it concise, don't repeat words, use words like blah blah blah and give it all the prompts for all the words that you want, and that you can say it in 4 to 17 words per sentence. That is the fastest and most digestible way to read a sentence on social media. So keep that in mind because it's a great tip, and chat can work that stuff out so easily. Alright. So I really sat down, and I thought, I used to be a photographer.

[00:19:12] Sue Bryce | So if you'd asked me 3 years ago, what's the Subrise experience? I would have given you the Subrise photo experience. Because it was magical, and it was what everybody wanted. So if you're a photographer, you go and create your experience. So I did this in your homework, but I also did this, so you have to put your name there, but this week, you have to tell me, what is that?

[00:19:37] Sue Bryce | And if you were to show that experience in a video, what would the narrative be? And what is the experience with you? And what will people get with you? And do you know that? Cause if you can't tell me that, you certainly cannot make me believe that you can do it for me.

[00:19:56] Sue Bryce | So I had to sit down and ask what's the subrace experience now? So as an educator, what is the subrace experience? So I had to come back to the drawing board and just be like, woah! I need to really like, start again with the whole how do I communicate the value of coming to one of my classes? How do I communicate the value of what I do now?

[00:20:26] Sue Bryce | In a video, and I'm gonna have it finished by the time we finish this coaching, but you gotta give me a few weeks because I'm busy, and I've got it's it's all just flowing out of my head right now, but you need to be able to tell me what that is. Now when it comes time for that timeline, this is an example. Now starting out self employed, like I said, if you're a designer and you're just starting out, you're like, I don't have that timeline for businesses. Don't make the narrative about building businesses. I have built and sold to businesses, but I've also built an international platform, you know, so I've built these massive things that are very relevant for me teaching business in the future.

[00:21:07] Sue Bryce | That's why I chose to do it like an infographic resume slash because it's got so much content in there. This would probably be your hardest page. We'll be finding the theme of your narrative that positions you So the big question you have to ask when you say how how can I position myself right now is you really have to ask yourself what part of all of this that I'm creating do I love so much that I want to make that the kind of narrative of what I talk about? Is there a number of testimonials that I should have on my about me? You know, I don't actually like testimonials because when I read them, I think they're bullshit.

[00:21:48] Sue Bryce | And also I think it's very easy for you to write, a testimonial and then put, a name. I like testimonials with a photo because to me it feels a little bit more like it's a real testimonial, and I'm not really that interested in testimonials. I would put them at the bottom if it looks good, but it'll also be the first thing I cut if I look at the page and feel like it's too busy, too wordy, it's getting lost, I'm not interested in what other people will say about me on my my about page, but they are on my website, so it's not too important. I would start with 33, and they have to position you so they have to be chosen that position you. So we all know that people are choosing testimonials that position them and make them look good because we're doing the same thing.

[00:22:39] Sue Bryce | So now you look at testimonials and you're like, but, like, it would be cool if you got a testimonial, so I thought about this. I thought about that, if any you should say that this was my go to. I figured my 2, I could do 3 testimonials right now, for people that have big social media following. And I was like, maybe I should go more for sort of, like, social proof, like, David, sir. He would write me a testimony all tomorrow because I still mentor David, any of 6,500,000 followers on social media, wouldn't that be a great testimonial for me because of who he is and that you know it's real?

[00:23:19] Sue Bryce | So as you're gonna build your client list, you're gonna build into better testimonials, but up until you get the Davids and thinks you're just getting, you know, Carol from Idaho, but as long as it's genuinely genuinely authentic and that it positions you and it's not too wordy, then that's a big one. There's just some a lot of conversation in there about German can't get it down to 14 words. Alright. Ask me lots of questions about the sales page because then I'm going to curate content for talks, but I really wanna just get this out so that everybody is very clear about what they're doing. Tell me why you decided to be self employed if it's relevant.

[00:23:57] Sue Bryce | Any narrative

[00:23:57] Jen | is interesting. If it's true. If it's authentic and if it's true to you, it's interesting.

[00:24:09] Sue Bryce | Alright. My field now is business, money,

[00:24:13] Jen | or self development. That's where I'm gonna be. I pretty much teach personal brand, content curation, public speaking,

[00:24:24] Sue Bryce | Those are these are my wheelhouse. So now I've gotta create this page as someone who teaches business, money, self development, and public speaking. I've gotta position every word on that to talk to the people who are reading it now. That's what's gonna make this a sales page, and that's what is going to make this very, very, very, very personalized and very cool. Can I expand on relevant to you?

[00:24:53] Sue Bryce | Alright. If I'm going to teach business, money, and self development in workshops, why would I talk about my dog or my kids? I just wouldn't. Like, people get out there, and they're like, I like, I like bajans and fluffy puppies, and cupcakes, and walking on the beach. And it's like, unless you're doing something on the beach that makes you money, let's it's not relevant to what it is that you're connecting with and selling and teaching.

[00:25:26] Sue Bryce | It's just not relevant. So you've gotta find the connection to that. I like my brief copy in my about page, so putting it on video would be better. Yeah. Brief copy is great.

[00:25:36] Sue Bryce | But they still don't believe people read it. So if you can find a way to write the copy that's more infographic, so it's more grabbing attention, short bursts, we suffer from, 3 second scroll, you're trying to stop somebody from scrolling in 3 seconds. So when somebody does go away from scrolling to, to your website, do you think they're gonna open an about page with words and just be like, Oh, let me just make a coffee while I read all this. It's the length of a Bible. And it's not interesting.

[00:26:08] Sue Bryce | It's not even relevant to what you do. You know, so keep it relevant, keep it short, keep it to your timeline. I'm gonna go and talk about creating content for network and marketing, but there are no questions about this. So where do you feel the most challenge about creating a page like this and who's excited to do it, and I bet you it's making a video.

[00:26:37] Veronica | There are a few questions about whether or not to write the copy in your native language or English.

[00:26:42] Sue Bryce | Most websites have translated now. So you'd have to be have the option to translate. Yeah. I wouldn't write if I lived in Germany, I wouldn't do a page in English. I'd do it in German, but I would also make it accessible.

[00:26:57] Sue Bryce | Yeah. You can also do a thing, I think. Alice did it where she could translate from French to English by clicking a button at the top. Would you like to see this website in French or English? So that must be a thing.

[00:27:10] Sue Bryce | I don't know enough about building websites. Sorry. Any more? Any questions in here? Mike?

[00:27:27] Jen | For the testimonial, do you recommend taking a screenshot of the Google review and putting a picture from their portrait session? Yeah.

[00:27:34] Sue Bryce | You could do that. You could do you could do that. But, also, if if it's a good Google review, you could absolutely do that because then people know it's on Google and they know it's legitimate. Yeah, for sure. I mean, that's just more proof.

[00:27:46] Sue Bryce | But, you know, the hard thing about Google testimonials is when you get a bad one, You know, you can't remove it. So it's like, but it's just one of those things. When you've got good ones, use it in every way that you can. I think that that's very, very important. Anymore.

[00:28:02] Sue Bryce | I did a training a while back. Where it was, was the about us? Should we be more, the about you using it to attract the ideal clients? I did a training a while back where it was a it was the about us. I don't understand the question.

[00:28:17] Sue Bryce | Sorry. Can you expand on that? And this new page is created where? It's, about page on your website, just like everyone has one already, but they all look like this. Sorry, Natalie.

[00:28:31] Sue Bryce | Actually, Natalie, I have to say you was a little bit more interesting than most, because you had small images and you had chose a shape that was a little different. Most others had pretty much a square or a rectangle. As a coach would make experience be my coaching style? Okay. That's probably a better way for me to run through a couple of scenarios with you.

[00:28:54] Sue Bryce | So if you were a coach, there'd be a beautiful picture of you with your 3 by 3 here. Here would be a relevant narrative to coaching.

[00:29:02] Jen | Right? So it would be why I

[00:29:02] Sue Bryce | became a coach, this is why I coach, I built this. I created this. This is why you need 1. This is how coaching changed my life, and you would find a way to do that that was not 750 words. It's either gotta be on an infographic, a video, you've gotta start getting a little bit more clever with this narrative, but the first thing you have to do is write it out.

[00:29:30] Sue Bryce | Write it out and use chat to do it. That's why we have this incredible resource. Once you start getting to this part, the invitation, that would be the, what you said, Victoria about the small text. That would probably be there. And this might not be something that exists for you, for another year.

[00:29:52] Sue Bryce | But trust me, it's going to because I'll do mine as soon as I can because I know the power of these videos. Then I can also track how many they're being watched. So as a coach, that would be my invitation to coaching, that would be pretty much a video of showing me coaching people. Because maybe in the background of

[00:30:09] Jen | this video, instead of it being

[00:30:09] Sue Bryce | a video of you designing or a photo of you, it's actually a video of you on stage. Perhaps it's a video of you, coaching a group, small group of people, and you can just because that image positions you. You can't hear any words. It's just a moving image of you teaching a workshop or anything where you have social proof. So when Melissa first came to me and said I wanna teach retreats because Melissa is a breast cancer survivor, And she wants to treat, teach retreats, she said, but I don't have a retreat, in order to sell the first retreat, but she's done many retreats.

[00:30:56] Sue Bryce | She just doesn't have any of the footage that you would get, like, if you were hosting a retreat. I said to her, you need to get to a hotel, somewhere with outdoor fires and stuff, like, we're in Arizona, so you can get some really cool desert hotels around here. You need to take 5 or 6 girlfriends. And tell them the theme. Like, if this is a pajama party, they bring colorful pajamas at whose was silk robes.

[00:31:23] Sue Bryce | She got everybody there for just a champagne evening together, and she bought the cheese, the crackers, and they shot all this fireside footage of her talking to everybody. This is all of her work now is on gonna be on this page advertising her retreats. And it's the visual connection to I'm I see Melissa as a host. I see she does breast cancer retreats for women. The visuals are showing me all these beautiful women in colors all sitting around, campfire, making s'mores, and drinking champagne, and And straight away, my I'm just like, would I have got the same feeling if I'd opened it and there was a nice static picture of Melissa?

[00:32:07] Sue Bryce | Or, like, like, having a ball, you know, and that's it. That's all just Melissa with her mouth open, showing a lot of teeth, and then a description of a retreat instead of looking at this retreat in the desert and feeling it. Now, the future is rich photo and rich video. All personal brands, the richer your photo and video is on this about page, the more eyeballs are gonna get to it. And this is exciting.

[00:32:37] Sue Bryce | This is so, so exciting. And I can just see that it's like, oh, okay. What if I'm catering to very different genres of photography, Sarah? This page is about you. It's about you.

[00:32:52] Sue Bryce | So you. You could have 2 info boxes or 3 and say, I shoot Boudoir, I shoot

[00:33:00] Jen | newborn babies, I shoot weddings. This is the story to all three reasons why

[00:33:00] Sue Bryce | I do these three things. 3 different narratives. 3 different boxes. Not one long, boring, confusing page. Like, it's kind of exciting.

[00:33:16] Sue Bryce | And now I'm like, oh, now I wanna get this finished.

[00:33:20] Veronica | There's a few questions about difference between the homepage and the About me page. So how much of about me do you put on your homepage? If any

[00:33:27] Sue Bryce | So when you get to your homepage, that doesn't have anything about you. It's the about page you click on that's about you. Your picture and and and spiel is not on your homepage. And did I not understand that? Right.

[00:33:47] Sue Bryce | Yeah. When you go to a homepage, you get a homepage with the name of the business might be you. But on that menu is about you. When I wanna know who the person is behind this website, that's the first page I click. Yorn, go to sleep, get out of the website.

[00:34:05] Sue Bryce | Might be time for a nap. Got it? I have a shortlist of my artist statement, first on my home page. You can keep an artist statement, but if it's text and they need to know more about you. It's got to go to your about page.

[00:34:21] Sue Bryce | What kind of page would you do if you're retired and you're following your passion project, but not necessarily selling anything, then why would you need a page? If you're not not necessarily selling anything, was a little bit of a gray area for me because I sell things. I don't necessarily sometimes not sell things. I'm always trying to sell something, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more on that, and you don't need, well, your about page should still be about your passion project, because it must have some connection to people. Otherwise, you know, it wouldn't, but just make it more about you.

[00:34:59] Sue Bryce | You can do, what kind of page would, okay, any other questions? Ask me about the sales page before we go. Okay, not selling something at this time, then just write about your passion project. Create the narrative around why you're doing a passion project If you want more eyes on your website, if you don't, you don't have to do this exercise. This is truly about putting yourself in your brand and connecting yourself more in your brand.

[00:35:25] Sue Bryce | Alright? Anything else? Alright. So at best, I think we should start with either a background image with our 3 by 3, followed by our, basically, our text page. And if we don't want to do that second page yet, if we can't quite work out what our narrative is, we can go straight to our invitation, straight to our short spiel that invites people why to come and see you, and then any relevant links can go on this page.

[00:35:56] Sue Bryce | Anything about you. Okay. Awesome. Alright. There's no more questions.

[00:36:03] Sue Bryce | I'm gonna move on. Alright. Everyone in the chat right now and people in this room say yes or no on the chat and put your hand up in this room if you are currently networking in person for your business. Okay. So going to networking meetings in person for your business.

[00:36:22] Sue Bryce | You can shout out in the chat. Don't lie to me. Don't say yes if you've just done one and you did a bad job at it. You're like, yeah, I've been networking. I have.

[00:36:30] Sue Bryce | I've done it. Don't say you're networking. I'm talking you've found networks in your in your area, and now you're like, I'm gonna put myself out there. I got a yes, no, yes, yes, yes, yes, occasionally, No. No.

[00:36:48] Sue Bryce | No. All the honest people. Very good. Okay. So how would

[00:36:49] Jen | you feel right now? Not as often as I could, Matt.

[00:36:50] Sue Bryce | I love that. How would you feel right now if I said you had to create a 5 minute presentation for your business for a networking event this week? K. Right? You got it?

[00:37:10] Sue Bryce | Alright. So I don't know how a lot of your networks work. I've had the opportunity to speak at several networks, and this is how I got the opportunity. The very first time, it was simply to introduce yourself, which was basically your 3 by 3. You stand out very nervously.

[00:37:25] Sue Bryce | Everybody's voice shook. I said something really stupid like Hi. My name's Sue, and I'm an alcoholic. Because I'm I was I was so nervous that I had to do it. I just said something stupid, you know, like that, and I was just like, I remember the first time I did that, and I was just like, nobody in this room even thought I this money.

[00:37:45] Sue Bryce | I was just like, I wanted to die and get really, really small, was pretty much just doing my 3 by 3, but then there was an opportunity to present for 5 minutes. And the goal was you're presenting to everybody in the networking room, no selling, You're simply presenting your business to everybody in that room, and a 5 minute talk is a long time. 13 minutes is a TED Talk. And it's actually the hardest talk I've ever, ever done, and I I failed at it. It was at the height of my menopause, and I was I I woke up that day, screwed up my talk, and rewrote it that morning.

[00:38:25] Sue Bryce | And I don't know why. I just didn't trust myself. I was in a horrible place. I did it. I knew I tanked.

[00:38:33] Sue Bryce | I was gutted afterwards, because it was like everything I wanted was to after speaking, was to get up there and slay that talk, and I want another go at it. But it's actually one of the hardest talks to curate. Because you have to very succinctly get to 13 minutes, and they cut you off. So you can't drop the ball, you can't segue, you can't go too short, you've gotta practice it and practice it and practice it. And being that I finished it an hour before I walked out there, I knew I screwed it up.

[00:39:07] Sue Bryce | And I was not prepared for that talk. I'll never let any of you do that. And this is something that I really wanna teach you today because it opens content curation to a point where it's, like, next step for everybody here, but that first step is to be able to just stand up and talk about my business. And myself, to a room full of people that own small businesses. So the fear of getting out there is the one thing, but you don't understand that everybody sitting in that room feels exactly like you, terrified, uncertain, am I even in the right place?

[00:39:44] Sue Bryce | Nobody has seen me today? Nobody has even asked me a question? Do you believe there's somebody sitting there just feeling completely isolated in that room full of people.

[00:39:56] Jen | And now you're gonna make this about you getting up on that stay, and how precious you are instead of what you can give every person in that room.

[00:40:08] Sue Bryce | You can give every person in that room a feeling of confidence, a feeling of being seen, and a feeling of being heard simply by standing in front of them confidently and looking at them. And they'll listen to you and connect with you, and you will have all this power in front of the room because you walked up there prepared and confident and in your authentic voice, and you knew what you were gonna say, and you were able to give You know, never once have I ever stood on stage like this, and and hope that everybody was giving me the attention that I hopefully

[00:40:43] Jen | was gonna get, that I would be up here, like, hopefully people

[00:40:43] Sue Bryce | are getting this, you stand on this stage, and it's a stage of giving. Like, everything I have to say, even about my business is gonna position me, every word I use will position me. And everything I say on this stage will position me in this room. So I'm not gonna go up there and and make it like a sales session. I can get up there very confidently, take a deep breath, and say, you know, guys, when you're sitting down there, it seems so much easier, and then everyone does a nervous laugh with you, but you don't get up there and say, I'm so nervous, and and you just butcher it because you're making it about you, you know, you gotta get up there in a big breath with all this confidence and talk about things.

[00:41:36] Sue Bryce | Now remember this. I was about to walk on set on creative life. I'd never done a live broadcast in my life. Never ever been filmed on camera as a photographer or an instructor. I'm about to deliver 12 keynotes in 3 days, 12

[00:41:49] Jen | 75 minute keynotes. My head

[00:41:49] Sue Bryce | is just full. I am so nervous I'm filled with self hate and self doubt because I'm old. My body is not good enough. I didn't bring the right clothes. Why am I even doing this?

[00:42:08] Sue Bryce | Why am I doing this? Why would I put myself out there like this to get publicly blade like this. What they're gonna set fire to me. I'm nobody. I don't even have an education.

[00:42:21] Sue Bryce | What am I doing? What am I doing? Why did I do this? Why? And I was standing there, and I'm hyperventilating And I just was like, I haven't eaten for 3 days.

[00:42:32] Sue Bryce | You know, I wanted to throw up. I wanted to lose all bowel control. I wanted to pass out, and I was like, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. How can I speak?

[00:42:42] Sue Bryce | How can I speak? And I was just like, I just stayed there in that moment. I just, like, pushed my feet down into the ground, and I prayed. And I just stayed there, and I said, I don't have to make these people like me. They probably won't.

[00:42:57] Sue Bryce | Some won't. I don't have to make these people

[00:43:01] Jen | like my work, because some of them won't. I just have to get

[00:43:01] Sue Bryce | up there and tell them why I love it. I have to get up there and tell them why I love doing it. I just have to get up there and tell them how I make money doing it. I just have to get up there and tell them that they can do a toad. That's what I have to do.

[00:43:25] Sue Bryce | I'm not

[00:43:25] Jen | here to make these people like me.

[00:43:25] Sue Bryce | Some won't, and I'm not here to make them like my

[00:43:29] Jen | work. I just have to tell them why I like it. Why I love doing it. Can you feel that?

[00:43:39] Sue Bryce | That's what I experienced. Right through to the moment I've still got goosebumps right through to the moment where I could say to myself, this is not about them liking you. What you see

[00:43:59] Jen | in me is in you.

[00:44:06] Sue Bryce | What you admire in me is in you. So when you say she's fierce, she's strong, she's fearless, she's powerful. It's because you have those traits like is a likeness. We like things about people because we are those things too. The same way that if you don't like something about me, you have to acknowledge that you also do this thing that you don't like.

[00:44:34] Sue Bryce | And you don't like it in me, which means you don't like it in you. So this idea that when we get up and we're authentic and we were truly our people, and then the people who like us, the people who resonate with our vibration, with our words with who we are and what we say and how we say it, they're our people. And, you know, Demali is, you know, come up as a coach, and she's a beautiful coach, and And I've been coaching Dimali. And as she became a coach, she came and did her first broadcast. And she came off the broadcast, and she called me, and I met with her afterwards.

[00:45:12] Sue Bryce | And she was like, I don't know that I enjoyed that. That was very stressful. And I don't know that I did a good job. And I said, well, do you believe you did a good job? And she said, yes.

[00:45:23] Sue Bryce | And I said, then what you're asking me is, do you think we thought you did a good job? And she said, yes. And I said, you did do a good job. Is that enough for you? And she was like, Well, I need the other people now to tell me I did a good job.

[00:45:35] Sue Bryce | And I said,

[00:45:35] Jen | do you really? And she was like, no. And I said, right. So

[00:45:36] Sue Bryce | understand this. I said this to Dimali. You, 70% of the people watching you today want to be you. People believe if you have the confidence to simply stand up on stage, you're already a 100% ahead of them. So they believe you're already important you were chosen, even though I chose to do this.

[00:46:05] Sue Bryce | But somehow you're important. So the 70 pea percent of people that want to be you, Demali, from this day 4th, are like, she's made it. I just want to be Demali. The other 30% came to watch because they think they're better than you. And they

[00:46:18] Jen | also want to be a coach and an instructor, so they just come to watch to see you be what they want to be.

[00:46:28] Sue Bryce | And they spent the whole time thinking she's not that good. I'm better. So that tells me you empowered 100% of the people watching. 70% of the wanna be you, and the other 30% think you're a piece that shouldn't think they're better. You empowered everybody in the room.

[00:46:47] Sue Bryce | How could you not? And it's still about all the people out there and nothing about you. So if you have practiced what you're gonna say, if you deliver it and if the content is good, and you gave everything, but you need to understand when you stand up on stage, you are not standing up on stage as a fledgling business, going, Hello, everybody. I'm just a little business owner over here. Nobody important.

[00:47:13] Sue Bryce | Hell, no. I left a full time employment. I created an income for myself. I am self employed. I'm a solo entrepreneur.

[00:47:21] Sue Bryce | I'm an entrepreneur. I am someone who creates their own business. I have the power, and I'm gonna go in there. I'm gonna stand up on that stage, and I'm gonna present my business, not as someone who is looking for any bookings or sales, In fact, at a networking, don't sell a damn thing. You don't need to act like you

[00:47:40] Jen | don't need to sell anything because it's already sold. Tell them what you do and why you do it and how you do it. And then give everybody

[00:47:40] Sue Bryce | in the room some reason. Some reason to remember you, give them good tips, give them information, you know, it's not about you, it's about what your business does for other people, and then everybody sitting in that room is gonna be like, and the more confidence that you can do this, the more confidence that you can stand up there and be in your most authentic self, the more you will attract every single person in that room. It is just magnetizing. Now I am an introvert, and I am very shy. If I went to

[00:48:19] Jen | a networking, I would take Melissa. She's my wing woman because I want

[00:48:19] Sue Bryce | somebody who's not shy and who's not afraid to just walk up to people But when I take a wing woman like Melissa, she can help me do that. She can help me be in that room. She can help me be comfortable because if I can lock in I can't do

[00:48:38] Jen | I can't do small talk.

[00:48:38] Sue Bryce | When I meet people, I wanna go very, very quickly. So when I'm with somebody and I lock in, I can connect with somebody in a heartbeat, but I need that wing woman to get me to that level. It's very important for me. So you stand up there. Now I'm shy, I'm introverted, and I need a wingman at my ad networking.

[00:48:58] Sue Bryce | But when I walk on stage, I know that all of my language, my whole everything is being

[00:49:11] Jen | curated for you tonight. That as I walk out here at this

[00:49:11] Sue Bryce | business, to talk about my business, I'm talking about what I can do for every person in this room by simply empowering all of them as to how I do that, and and how it empowers me, and and I show examples. And don't worry, I've got a big list. Are there any questions here?

[00:49:37] Jen | How does one find a wing woman? Ah, yes. So, you know, the it's

[00:49:38] Veronica | specifically a marketing oh, gosh.

[00:49:50] Sue Bryce | I teach startup business, and I have for 15 years. The most mind blowing thing to me is the ones that were natural networkers, like Melissa, like Nicky. Like I said to Nicky, you have to go to a, like, a networking event and you need to get known that you need to within a week, she was like, I've got 3 networks, and I'm the main photographer for this one, and I'm, and I'm doing that. And I was like You're really going to do all of that? And she's like, Oh, I love networking.

[00:50:18] Sue Bryce | She's like, like, 3% of the people I get. Most people are terrified of even walking into a room. So you just gotta find the nikis and the militias of the world. There are just people that love networking, and you become friends with them. And before long, or go with somebody that's also in a similar type business or another business that wants to join that network, go together and make a friend,

[00:50:38] Jen | and then alliance with each other. It's the fastest way

[00:50:39] Sue Bryce | to doing it truly, truly work. I did a 30 minute talk at our local women's business network in our chamber trade show stage and a 20 minute talk. Woah. If I'd gotten a chance to get up there and do a 20 minute talk back then, I would have sucked, but now I would delay it. I would slay it.

[00:51:02] Sue Bryce | Okay. Let's talk about what we're gonna say.

[00:51:04] Veronica | Would you recommend past clients become wing women?

[00:51:07] Sue Bryce | Yes. If they are there also to network, you can't just take somebody that's just like a and they see your assistance or there's some kind of working with you that is, like, gonna make it work. And remember, it's not an entourage. Okay. I'm not gonna stick with you the whole night.

[00:51:26] Sue Bryce | I gotta let the butterfly fly she basically is gonna set me up all night. Like, I go from this conversation, like, we should talk more. Thank you. Oh, yeah, let's follow. Okay.

[00:51:38] Sue Bryce | Great. And also, you know, I always open my Instagram. I've always opened my Instagram at networking, and people are like, Who

[00:51:44] Jen | are you?

[00:51:46] Sue Bryce | Like, it's just so instant. It's like straight away. So I'm always like, yeah. So it's like connecting this way to look up, Melissa will be like, hey, you need to come and meet this person. Right?

[00:51:57] Sue Bryce | I've got my next meeting. Thank you. But that's what it's like for me, because I also, you know, sometimes you can walk into a networking, go and talk to the shyest person who's standing on the periphery, and then you get stuck with them. And it's like, honey, I can't drag you through this meeting. I would drag myself through this meeting, I'm not dragging you through this meeting as well.

[00:52:17] Sue Bryce | So, you know, either chip it up or where you go. Go meet somebody else. So you don't wanna get stuck with somebody that you don't wanna be stuck with. Okay. So this is very, very important.

[00:52:26] Sue Bryce | Alright. Now as you know, and a lot of you have done content curator, I specifically curate content for workshops and stage, and this is what I need you to learn right now. If you are going to do any presentation, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, the first thing you need to be able to do is your 3 by 3. And I want you to slay that 3 by 3. Now if my 3 by 3 is also at the top of my page, I worked out when I'm with people with networking, I shorten my 3 by 3.

[00:52:56] Sue Bryce | I change my 3 by 3. I make my 3 by 3 more casual. For instance, boom, first thing I say is I teach workshops in person and online. I broadcast, podcast, and speak on stage. That's all I need to say, right?

[00:53:11] Sue Bryce | For anybody to go, who are you? What do you do? So straight away, I can shorten my 3 by 3 in my presentation to make it relevant to the people in the room. I need to understand that I I if I have a slideshow or not. That's one of the biggest things that's very, very important And more importantly is if I have a slideshow, I need you to understand something really simple.

[00:53:34] Sue Bryce | A slideshow means you guys are getting

[00:53:34] Jen | a slideshow. But if there's a

[00:53:34] Sue Bryce | slideshow that the audience can see, Can you see this camera and this TV in front of me? Actually, is there any camera that can pick up this, the my setup from my angle? Yeah. Callen?

[00:53:51] Jen | Yeah.

[00:53:51] Sue Bryce | So you guys can see I'm looking at the audience, and behind the audience is my screen. And my keynote. So I know what you guys are looking at at the front, and in front of me down here is the chat, so I can see what you guys are saying, although Melissa's monitoring the chat. So I try not to look down, because obviously when I'm on stage, if I'm looking down, I'm not looking up at the camera, which is there. So that's just my backup, because I'll say, are there any questions I can look down if the chat's rolling, which means there's questions coming, and I've got my eye on those things.

[00:54:25] Sue Bryce | When you do a presentation, there's often a slideshow that you can plug into,

[00:54:30] Jen | but they often won't have a monitor in

[00:54:30] Sue Bryce | front of you, so that means your monitor will be your laptop, which is plugged in, and if it is your laptop, it will be on a lectern, right? So it'll be there on a lectern, and you won't be moving. You're going to be standing here reading behind a lectern. And that's not what I want. But if it's a 5, 10 minute presentation, it might just be a microphone, and it might not even be that.

[00:54:58] Sue Bryce | Like, at that point, it might just be me standing up in front of a group. If I have the ability to show a slideshow, I have the ability to put rich content and what makes any brand incredible, rich video, and rich photography. Luckily, a slideshow,

[00:55:11] Jen | especially if you're a photographer, gives you

[00:55:11] Sue Bryce | the opportunity to then show beautiful before and afters, examples behind the scenes, BTS, a video, and action. If you don't have a slideshow, you don't have the ability to do this. First question you ask, how many people will be at the event And what would you like me to speak about? This is a presentation about you and your business. Great.

[00:55:39] Sue Bryce | Okay. Well, I do this, and I'm gonna teach this. And I know

[00:55:43] Jen | this is a business network, and I know that my skill

[00:55:43] Sue Bryce | is relevant to their business in this way. So I'm gonna put in one tip, a really important tip, or 5 tips that they will be able to use as a business owner. Let me give you an example. I'm a photographer and I photograph personal branding images, which are like lifestyle images for business. Right?

[00:56:04] Sue Bryce | And so if you're a business right now, let me give you 5 tips as to why going to a professional like me is gonna change your brand, and that would be how you finish. But you're not selling yourself you're saying it just like this is information everybody needs. And if you don't want me, go to somebody else, but you need these 5 things in your brand right now. Use them this way. Take your personal branding.

[00:56:27] Jen | Use it in your social media these three ways. Not only did you just present your business to

[00:56:30] Sue Bryce | the people, you just gave them 5 incredible tips about their business, then you showed on the slideshow how good your work is. Guess who I'm coming to talk to after this talk. Alright? It all sounds so easy. Let's go.

[00:56:49] Sue Bryce | So what do we write in this talk? Number 1, if we don't have a slideshow, we've got to talk it out, and that's okay. We're going to introduce the problem, and then we're going to solve the problem. So what's the biggest problem you solve? Because this is the moment that you throw out conflict to people.

[00:57:06] Sue Bryce | Like, most people don't put themselves out there because, and then you'd say that is the conflict. And then everybody who like, connects to what you're saying, and the audience is like, oh my gosh, that's me. That's me. That's so me. That's so me.

[00:57:24] Sue Bryce | And you're speaking to the problem, and yet you're the face of your brand. So imagine if you went to a networking event and said, I did this. I did that. I did this. I did that.

[00:57:38] Sue Bryce | I curate the beautiful personal branding. Why don't you all pull up your about page right now and see how exciting your about page is? Just for an example, and then you watch everybody at that network and go, oh, I've got a photo and lots of texts, and then there'll be, well, I don't even have a photo. Right, Joe? Like, oh gosh, I just realized there isn't even a personal photo of me on there.

[00:58:02] Sue Bryce | Is there Joe? Terrible, but there will be today when you get home, I'm sure. So if you think about it like that, that's selling on the periphery, I don't need to sell anything. I just gave you a gift And that gift was more valuable than anything else you could give me. Okay.

[00:58:20] Sue Bryce | So I call it in the 5 minute, this is the 5 minute to start. 5 minute presentation, I say share a game changing tip, solve the problem be educational, be empowering. Tell a story to make them remember you. Tell a story that makes them remember you. And remember it's not about you.

[00:58:38] Sue Bryce | It's about you, but it's not about you. Okay. This is about your business, but it's about how your business does incredible thing and changes a whole lot of people's lives. That's what you have to say. You are there to present.

[00:58:50] Sue Bryce | You are not there to sell. Do not sell. Do not do not be stinky. You are not to go up there stinky. If you need money, get your energy right before you stand up in front of those people, because you're just gonna get up there smelling, and everyone's gonna go oo gross, and then you're just smelly in front of everybody.

[00:59:09] Sue Bryce | And nobody wants to be smelling. So act like you don't need the work. Act like you're fully booked?

[00:59:13] Jen | Cause you are. Right now you're fully booked trying to make this work. You are.

[00:59:23] Sue Bryce | You are. Stop saying you've got time. You don't. It's not like you've got any like, you don't have time. You could get up there and say, hi guys.

[00:59:32] Sue Bryce | I'm stressed out because I'm just not making as much money as I'd like to, but I'm really trying to. Do you think you're gonna get quiet where you can't get clients if you suck. So, no, you get up there. It's just not the energy you gotta walk up there with. You are fully booked.

[00:59:46] Sue Bryce | I'm fully booked trying to make this work. Right now, I'm bringing all of my energy focus and attention to the table because until you can bring your focus to you, you can't shift it. You know? Find another shy girl, and then you both will shine. She also might follow you around for the rest of the night, so you've got to set some boundaries too.

[01:00:08] Sue Bryce | You've also gotta get really good at passing people off. You know, like, and and the fastest way to pass somebody off is, you know what? I need to introduce you to somebody. Yeah. Come with me.

[01:00:21] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Alright. Or the other one is this, listen, I really need to go to the bathroom. Will you walk with me and talk with me so that we can, like, walk and talk because I've gotta go. And then they'll walk you to the bathroom, and then you're like, cool.

[01:00:33] Sue Bryce | Then you go to the bathroom, wash your hands, and often they're waiting when you come out.

[01:00:36] Jen | With a towel. I'm kidding. There's a

[01:00:37] Sue Bryce | boundary you cross. Okay. So telling a story know your audience. That's the secret. You've gotta really know your audience.

[01:00:56] Sue Bryce | And if you really sort of know your audience, then you can really give them all of those things. Don't worry. You get all these slides as usual. So what is your game your game changer tip? What made you instantly think, and how many of you thought I don't think I know what my game changer tip would be?

[01:01:16] Sue Bryce | What would be the one tip that you would drop to a networking right now? 1. Now what if it's a bigger talk? What if it's a 20 minute presentation? 3 by 3?

[01:01:28] Sue Bryce | Yes. Show what you do if there's a slideshow. If there's not a slideshow, you ask for a product table. Okay? So if it's just a networking event and they don't have they don't have graphics for you, you're just gonna get up there and wing it.

[01:01:42] Sue Bryce | You need to bring stuff that people can touch, because if people touch stuff, they buy it, they go home with it. So if you can't get that ask for a product table, share 5 game changing tips, 5 game changers, Right? It's exactly the same flow, know your audience. If you're gonna talk for 20 minutes to these people, what would your 5 most powerful tips be? So in content curation, you're going to start with the title of your talk.

[01:02:10] Sue Bryce | And whatever the title of your talk is is relevant to the people sitting here. So is it business? Is it, self awareness? Is it selling? Is it marketing?

[01:02:32] Sue Bryce | Like, what really is it? Kind of pick a theme and then decide to, yeah, I'm really gonna hit this. I really wanna talk to people about marketing, and how it's changing so much. And I really want to do that, and then it's like, cool. So what audience do I have?

[01:02:47] Sue Bryce | What do they need to know about marketing? What are the marketing tips I would give them, and how are they relevant to my brand and my narrative right now, and what this is in business, because that's really what it comes down to is what are these 5 tips. And once you really start to think of it, and I love playing this game, So if you wanna do that, how would I what would I talk about if I wanted to blah, blah, blah, do this? Cause I love relating content. Everyone's laughing and saying, now I'll know when I've been passed off when I walk through to the toilet.

[01:03:25] Sue Bryce | Sometimes I really just need to go to the toilet, though. Alright. Anybody got any ideas for

[01:03:29] Jen | tips for me, or anybody want to talk about it?

[01:03:41] Veronica | There are a few questions in the chat about how to really

[01:03:43] Jen | stand out in the crowd. Ultimately, standing out comes down to confidence. Right? And confidence

[01:03:44] Veronica | is not something that you can practice.

[01:03:56] Sue Bryce | Or learn, it only comes with action. And the crazy part is is the solar plexus is your energy center for action. Right? And it's also where your identity is formed. Here, not here.

[01:04:13] Sue Bryce | So the identity is formed

[01:04:14] Jen | in action. Only in the doing of it, do you become it?

[01:04:24] Sue Bryce | You can visual visualize it, you can know it, faith, vision, truth. You can even speak the truth and say this is what I want. The heart is activated. The next energy center is the solar plexus is self power. The difference between most people and someone who's confident is someone who's confident has a strong self power center here.

[01:04:51] Sue Bryce | You can see eating disorders, you see them on bodies because it's like the collapse of the solar plexus. The solar plexus is where we hold ourselves with pride. It's where we lift our chest up to be greeted, and and it's where we hold our own. And the identity that you're walking into is formed in the action of it. So only in the doing of it will you become the identity that you want to become.

[01:05:18] Sue Bryce | And there's really no other way to do it. If I think back to myself on stage, I was just an unpolished version of what I am now. That was it. I just hadn't practiced, and I hadn't and I threw there's only one way to know how it feels to speak to 300 people. Let's walk out on that stage, you know, wanting to pass out in hyperventilating, and and finding the voice in there.

[01:05:48] Sue Bryce | I wasted too much time in the beginning, wondering if I was good enough to talk on stage instead of curating content that was interesting enough that would keep me up on stage. Anybody can get on stage It's getting invited back. That's the hard part. Everyone thinks it's getting on the stage is easy, getting on the stay a hard, getting on the stage is easy. Saying something worth it while you're up there is whether or not you get back again.

[01:06:17] Sue Bryce | That's the part that it mazes me. So you're gonna go back and you gotta do it. So the first time you do it, you'll do it to five people. My first presentation was to 25 people, 25 people for 8 hours. I was so nervous.

[01:06:32] Sue Bryce | My next one was 300 main stage national conference for the AIPP. I don't know how I got that big so quickly, but I was just, like, three hundred people And when I think back, it was a beautiful talk. I was just unpolished. That's all. That's it.

[01:06:53] Sue Bryce | 15 years later, I don't think twice about it. Do I still have all the adrenaline in my body? Yes. A 100%. It's crazy.

[01:07:00] Sue Bryce | There is nothing crazier. I've created a speaker workshop, but it's an in person workshop. There is nothing like it in the world than the energy you get of of learning how to walk out on stage and present your business. I don't care if you don't want to be a speaker, I need you to be able to do this. This will change your business.

[01:07:20] Sue Bryce | Your ability to network like this and get up in this room will change the trajectory of your business. You have a question there? Are you just holding that? I'm just holding it. You can put it down.

[01:07:32] Sue Bryce | I

[01:07:32] Jen | don't wanna

[01:07:33] Melissa | share one of my

[01:07:33] Veronica | tip later.

[01:07:34] Sue Bryce | I'll have to go back to it. Okay. No one out there can hear you if you don't eat it.

[01:07:40] Melissa | I was just gonna share one of my tips for whenever I am at, like, a networking event for the people that I'm working with. A lot of them don't know what word or, like, how they want their clients to feel. So I always ask them, how do you want clients to feel no matter what business it's in.

[01:07:56] Sue Bryce | That's a good one.

[01:07:57] Melissa | Whether it's law, photography, hairstylists, and they love it because they really start to think about it.

[01:08:02] Sue Bryce | Yes. What is your experience?

[01:08:04] Melissa | So far, a lot of people tell me that they want their clients to feel confident, and then I follow-up with how do you allow them to feel confident in

[01:08:10] Sue Bryce | your space? I don't even know.

[01:08:12] Melissa | Yeah. It's really cool.

[01:08:13] Sue Bryce | So the one thing I noticed too about people is they also at the networking event, everyone is gauged whether they are seen. Like, one of my friends came home years ago, and she was like, not one person asked me a single question. And I said, oh, how many questions did you ask? And she instantly went like this. And it turns out she doesn't ask questions either, and she just couldn't understand why nobody wanted to know about her.

[01:08:43] Sue Bryce | I said, well, why would anybody wanna know about you if you didn't wanna know about them? And she was like, oh, no, it wasn't like that. It was just like, I was talking to a lot of people. They just weren't asking me any questions. I said, cool.

[01:08:57] Sue Bryce | And again, how many questions did you ask? But what you what Veronica just said was Sometimes something so simple like that. Most people they talk to want their clients to experience something, but don't know how to take them through that experience. If you have learned that, then you can speak to that. That's solving problems.

[01:09:18] Sue Bryce | So when I say to you, you guys I give you guys bullet point steps. This is what you do next step, next step, next step, then I see where you get stuck. When I see where you get stuck, I can solve the problem to get you to the next level, and I just keep solving your problems, that's called selling on the periphery. So if you identify something like what Hidotica just said, this is a problem for people, then if she gets up and solves that problem in front of people, but not talking to the person, if she gets up and says, do you know what your client experiences? Anyone in the room is a business owner, and they go, do I know what my client experiences?

[01:09:58] Sue Bryce | Is that client experience on the website? Can you communicate your client experience? To your client, can you communicate it to me right now? And then everyone's like, this is the moment you realize when you create a business, you've learned all the stuff, and you can share all this incredible stuff you learn, but you don't know what you know until you go to teach it. And that's why when you get up and you relate to people like that, those people who do feel that way will come up to you afterwards, and what will they say to you What would they say to you?

[01:10:33] Sue Bryce | It's a very specific thing. You were speaking directly to me. And that's what I hear the most. So it was like you're talking to me. I was like, yeah, cause you're me.

[01:10:49] Sue Bryce | And I just told you about me, and you were like, I did that too. And I was like, yes, that's cool. That's how it works. So if you think you don't have knowledge, if you've built a business, you have knowledge. If you have solved a problem for yourself and business, you can solve a problem for everybody in this room,

[01:11:07] Jen | solve 5 problems, solve 5 problems, just as bullet points, and watch everybody follow you home.

[01:11:16] Sue Bryce | Because the one thing that people do when they get up in front of you is they don't give me anything as the listener. I don't want to listen to you talk about yourself for 20 minutes you are not that important.

[01:11:31] Jen | If what you're saying is not for me, I don't care about you.

[01:11:32] Sue Bryce | I'm going to check my phone and yawn. Because it's not interesting.

[01:11:47] Jen | So yes, you have to make yourself interesting, but you've got to get

[01:11:47] Sue Bryce | it yourself up there in all of your power, and you've got to deliver from a place of power. It's not a place of validation. It's not a place of am I good enough? The stage is spotlight on you. If you are being insincere, up there, everyone will feel it.

[01:12:11] Sue Bryce | You can't lie. You can't hide, you just gotta be up there in your most truth, giving information to people, but don't give too much information because then they just are like, I think that that was 3 talks rolled into 1. Why do we do that? Because as a woman who never felt good enough, whenever I curated content, I had to put in more content because I felt like the content had to be valuable because I was not. So I would over give my content, but overgiving content translates into a whole lot of people getting 50 bullet points that is like, this is 3 separate talks why did you do this?

[01:12:53] Sue Bryce | Recently, I was at a photo talk. I watched the presenter get to the 45 minute mark,

[01:12:58] Jen | and they were slaying this talk, not the first time I've heard her speak, and

[01:12:58] Sue Bryce | I was just like, she is hitting this talk oh, I've never heard of this talk before. I was writing the review for in my head, and at 45 minutes, she started a completely different keynote that was talking about marketing and started to segway with all this marketing information that was coming out in droves, and it was just coming out and boom, boom, boom, because I just need to give more value and give more value. And I was like, damn, you had a standing ovation 15 minutes ago. Now you just got a whole lot of people going, that was full on. And then I went to then she finished the talk and she got the clap, and I was just like, oh, we need to talk.

[01:13:41] Sue Bryce | But that's what I do, right? And I wanna talk for all the speakers and say, this is what you did, right? This is what you did wrong. In overgiving is like another thing that we do, and it's so weird to me, but I am the classic overgiver. So of course, it went I know exactly what that's gonna translate into, and it's what it felt like, so it's like, Alright, bullet time.

[01:14:02] Sue Bryce | So I want you to make a list of the main points that you need to hit at this talk. Truly bullet points. I teach in bullets. I'm doing a presentation in business today, and there are 5 things that I truly need to communicate to everybody, right? 5 things.

[01:14:24] Sue Bryce | So those are my first slides, those are 5 slides, and they are my main points, and your main points become your keynote. Alright? Straight away, those are my main points. Now the deal is no fluff. Your keynote has no fluff.

[01:14:41] Sue Bryce | You can speak as much fluff as you want, but the fluffy bit is not in your keynote. That is information and data and inspiration. It's empowering. It's entertaining. It's engaging.

[01:14:52] Sue Bryce | It is not in its educational. It's not fluff. Okay. The fluff is a story, the fluff is, you know, the bits that you add on. Number 3 is you're going to put that list in linear order so that the five points are gonna come out in order of how you need to say them.

[01:15:10] Sue Bryce | Because they're relevant to the narrative that you're going to weave inside these points. Start to think about the time that you're about to speak. There is a very interesting correlation between content and time.

[01:15:26] Jen | You see content spoken, it takes about, 7 50 words for a 5 minute presentation. So if you write out your

[01:15:29] Sue Bryce | keynote, and you look at your word count and it says 750 words, it's going to take you about 5 minutes to read that, but I don't want you to read a keynote. Because if I wrote out a 5 minute talk and I stood behind a lectern, This is how it would be. My name is Sue Bryce. I've been a professional photographer for 35 years. I might as well just stand up and read a book, but if I put the main points of my keynote there, and that I can see that I only have five points.

[01:16:14] Sue Bryce | And if you

[01:16:14] Jen | can't have a a slideshow, you can have 5 cards.

[01:16:15] Sue Bryce | You're allowed to hold cards, their prompts, and it's gonna these five points are the 5 things that you really are trying to communicate today, and then to make this a narrative, they become your slides. Now think about it, time and content. If I'm going to speak for 5 minutes and I have 5 slides how

[01:16:38] Jen | long do I talk about

[01:16:38] Sue Bryce | each slide? I've got one minute. See how all of a sudden it changes everything. If I've got 20 minutes and I've got 5 slides, I've got 4:4 a minute, 4 minutes a slide that I can hit home. Now, if you do have a presenter note or a computer, underneath the slide can be presenter notes.

[01:17:05] Sue Bryce | On the keynote, you can write presenter note. Nobody sees the presenter notes, they just see the slide, alright? So that's a good way for you to add prompts or, again, have prompts here. But if you're going to talk for 20 minutes, that's around 3000 words, right? 3000 words, and a TED talk is 13 minutes.

[01:17:30] Sue Bryce | So in this moment, that's how you curate this content because in between all

[01:17:37] Jen | of your slides, you're going to add a story. Oh, let's say

[01:17:37] Sue Bryce | I'm gonna do the slide and I've got some data points to show. Let's say I'll I'll show this point, and I've got a before and after, and I also have a video. Alright? Let's say I get this one, and I've got a really cool story to tell, and then this one is, oh my gosh, I've got, what could I do about this? This was really an action point, and it's really, I'm gonna bring it home, so I'm gonna get up and actually act that out.

[01:18:13] Sue Bryce | I'll show people. And then you start to curate what you're gonna speak about on each of those main points, and it's so simple. It's so much easier than you think it is. And it's really about just staying on point with those, all of those points. So I always say add notes, add a story, add social proof.

[01:18:38] Sue Bryce | If you have visual, add data, add a before, and after, and then all you have to do is practice and breathe. Practice and breathe, practice and breathe, practice and breathe, practice and breathe, and don't stop breathing, because otherwise you'll die. And trust me, it's feels like it when you're out there. So to me, I'm like, what are my main points? What are the main points that I want to hit home?

[01:19:04] Sue Bryce | What stories can I tell around it? And the difference being is recently, somebody curated a talk for stage, and they said to me, Hey, can you listen to my keynote? And I was like, yes. Right? I'm sitting there all like, yay, yay, yay.

[01:19:19] Sue Bryce | And they start to read it to me. Like, reading it. They've written it, like, a book. And I was like, oh, no. In about 3 minutes, and I was like And she was like, oh, And I was like, honey, this is a book.

[01:19:39] Sue Bryce | This is now the stage presentation. And she was like, well, but I just read it. I'm Electurn microphone. I was like, oh my gosh, people are gonna stand there for an hour. This thing, do you read a book?

[01:19:51] Sue Bryce | I was like, I've got a Twitch already, and I'm only, like, 4 minutes in, and it's really interesting content, but I said, do this. Take that, put it into chat, say, what are the main points of this talk? Give me 20 bullet points that are the main points of this talk, get them into bullet points, those are your main talks, and then make those your slides, and then flip those slides. Now I call this flipping. It's really simple.

[01:20:20] Jen | When you first start thinking, what content am I gonna share? It comes out like a list, and I call it bullet points.

[01:20:30] Sue Bryce | They're bullets. Literally. These are bullet points. They teach them bullet points, and the reason I do that is because there's no fluff. We're just getting all of the content and the information down.

[01:20:40] Sue Bryce | What needs to be transferred? What do they need to know? What do I need to hit home? What is gonna tie my narrative to their narrative, and then once I got them all locked in, they're just one slide with one statement on it. I turn them into titles like that.

[01:20:58] Sue Bryce | So they're at the top of the list, and I start building more content under it. So basically I'm building verticals now of content.

[01:21:04] Jen | So if this is sales and this is marketing and that's product

[01:21:10] Sue Bryce | and branding. I can talk about branding for 12 years, but I can only talk about selling for 3, and I've got a lot to say about customer service. You start growing this content, and all of a sudden the verticals start getting deeper. And when your verticals get deeper, you're like, I know a lot about branding. And if you know a lot about branding, then it doesn't take long to stand up in front of people and say, how many of your personal brands and start talking about branding in a way that's knowledgeable that people are like, wow, I need that.

[01:21:44] Sue Bryce | She's got information. This is really interesting. Crazy. So really what you're doing is you're finding your main point turning them into titles and then growing the content under it, which would be next steps. What else do I need to learn?

[01:21:59] Sue Bryce | It's my depth of knowledge and experience around this area, and there's nothing wrong with you creating all of that content in that moment and then going cool, but for this networking event, I'm only going to talk about this because that is marketing the small business, and that is my talk right there. You don't have to give them a little bit of everything. You give them a little bit of one wow, and then, you know, and then you fill it in, and it's like, it's just something that I realized in that moment, everybody's sitting in the room feeling exactly the same way. I don't know how to take the next step. 1, everyone's acting like they've got their shit together, and they don't.

[01:22:46] Sue Bryce | Everyone's acting like they make money, that'll be the biggest lie you're here, and everybody is acting like, you know, that that they're all precious and and and anxious in the room because there's a lot of energy in that room that is social conditioning. And it's crazy to me because, you know, I always say it like this. When you need validation, you're tran you're, receiving. Right? But when you're transmitting, you're giving.

[01:23:15] Sue Bryce | The energy is going out from you, not towards you. So if you walk into this networking, needing validation and attention, you're going in as a receiver, and it's so palpable. I don't want to be surrounded by receivers like that because they need, and they come up to you, and they need you. And it's like, no, I'm giving them power. Like, you're there to give power in confidence, and it's such an it's such an incredible thing too.

[01:23:45] Sue Bryce | So, yes, what else? Visuals, data before and after? And you don't have to pretend to be anybody you're not when you're speaking. Like, I do watch my p's and q's, and, you know, try not to swear and things like that unless it's relevant to the talk. But at the end of the day, I'm not trying to be the world's most perfect speaker or trying to speak I'm trying to be the most authentic person on stage with my microphone.

[01:24:12] Sue Bryce | Giving as much connected information as I can actually give. So the one thing that I get from a lot of people with my talks is I'm often addressing business, photo, pretty much business and photo. Those are the two places that I get to talk the most. Even if I'm not there to teach, I give so much in my talks, as you know, but I don't hold back. Gets invited back to the stage every single time?

[01:24:43] Sue Bryce | This girl, I still give more than most, and I still will give more than most because I have it to give, and it's just gonna keep making me a better speaker. But I gotta know what the give is. So when you really sit down now, tell me what makes you unique as a business owner, and what make what lights you up? What systems did you build that you were like, wow, because I can guarantee you, there are just hundreds of people around you that want to know about it, and you didn't even know that it was important. Yes.

[01:25:17] Sue Bryce | I mean, chat TPT. For real.

[01:25:24] Veronica | There are a few questions back to the client experience. And what is the difference between the chat or, excuse me, what is the difference between the client experience? And the client journey.

[01:25:37] Sue Bryce | Oh, I don't really I don't it's the same thing. Okay. Wouldn't it be the same thing? I mean, to me, a client experiences the journey they have with you, or It's just what is the

[01:25:52] Jen | what is

[01:25:52] Veronica | the client they respond

[01:25:53] Sue Bryce | to it? I don't know that a lot of us can answer what your client experience is. Well, it was for me because my business was very experienced based as a photographer, so to me, that was the experience. But now that I'm not doing a experience for photographers, now that I'm doing it more for teaching, what would my client experience be now? I want people to know what their client experience is.

[01:26:19] Sue Bryce | So the journey, the experience is the same thing.

[01:26:21] Veronica | Can you over give in that client experience?

[01:26:24] Sue Bryce | Well, you could make it, people only people don't don't read and they only remember what comes out of their own mouth. So if you put too much information on there, it won't get watched. Yeah. It's gotta be interesting enough to hold their attention. And it's also gotta be something that it's easy to read, but it's not until you speak with them, that you hear it, come back, and that's why I don't want people to send this out.

[01:26:51] Sue Bryce | I want people to call their clients, but, you know,

[01:26:56] Jen | A lot of people don't like that. How to translate all of this

[01:26:56] Sue Bryce | for the online world? Well, YouTube. That's the networking stage online that's free. So once you've done the talk and networking, you record it on a video and put it on YouTube or on your about page. Let's go.

[01:27:22] Sue Bryce | More questions. Yes. I don't wanna raise an

[01:27:23] Jen | army of Givers Bridget. I wanna raise an army of people that are connected to their content.

[01:27:35] Sue Bryce | And, ah, valuing it in equal exchange. I've always been an overgiver. I don't want to always be an overgiver. I want to be a giver that's in, equal exchange with what I give. So are always earning and receiving as much as I give out and making sure I stand balance is really, really important.

[01:28:01] Sue Bryce | So Kate, you say a personal branding is not your main niche. What would you talk about at a networking event? I don't know what you do. So, I'm assuming you're a portrait photographer, but not everyone in here is portrait photographers. So it was a very niche question because you're asking as a photographer.

[01:28:22] Sue Bryce | So as a photographer that's speaking to a roomful of people, here's something that I would do. What's the first thing you do when you look out and you think, okay, I'm talking to a room of non photographers, people not like me, is I go, are they men and women? Are they in business? Do they have children? Instantly, I'm starting to go through all the the ticks

[01:28:45] Jen | that you are like, oh yeah, this is a business network, so I can

[01:28:45] Sue Bryce | talk about business. This is, mostly female. Or mostly parents, so I can talk

[01:28:57] Jen | about family portraits. Like, I look for the relatable in every group of people. That's probably the most important part, and you only

[01:28:57] Sue Bryce | wanna give them one tip to move forward. So if it's a short talk, so just think about what that one thing would be, that they would remember you. But just because you're talking to a business network, okay, this is what's gotten away on me. I am there to present about my business, I'm just tying the content into the audience to make me more relatable in the room. So you're just presenting your business.

[01:29:27] Sue Bryce | If you don't have a business tip for them, you're still a business owner, so you could still drop in a business tip. But if it's not relatable to what you sell, find something that is relatable to what you sell with the people in the room. Don't that make sense? Okay. Maternity photographer.

[01:29:53] Sue Bryce | There you go. Well, you're looking for bumps at

[01:29:55] Jen | that point, and so you're looking for anybody that's had a bump, wants to have a bump, has got a granddaughter with a bump, and so you're looking basically at any woman and most

[01:29:55] Sue Bryce | networking are women's groups anyway.

[01:30:08] Jen | I think a great tip to think about when you're going to

[01:30:08] Veronica | networking is always understanding your why and asking other people what their why is. When you explain your mission and you ask for theirs, it's a great way to champion when another you know, and really build on that. How

[01:30:23] Sue Bryce | can you You know, people ask the question of what they most this is really important. If somebody says to you, do you have children? They have children. Okay. If I I don't ask that question.

[01:30:36] Sue Bryce | I say, what's your

[01:30:37] Jen | business? Cause I just assuming everyone's self employed. So if somebody comes up to you and says, are you self employed? They don't have children. That's how it works.

[01:30:37] Jen | It's like, we ask the 1st most out

[01:30:37] Sue Bryce | we actually ask from our highest values. Do you believe that? So there's always a relatable thing there. Secondly, what questions are you going to ask people at a networking event that will position you? Because if you ask the right questions, they ask the same

[01:31:08] Jen | question back to you. What about you? They return it. And when they return the Volley, you already set up your question knowing full well that you

[01:31:08] Sue Bryce | had a perfect answer for it. And that that's what it's going to be. Yeah, I think that's really important,

[01:31:20] Jen | really get your questions right, know what you're doing there, work out what it is that you're doing. You know,

[01:31:21] Sue Bryce | when you do media training, like, when you go on the today show, the talk or any of that, they make you do all this media training because they're like, it's gonna be fast. It's gonna be furious. It's a big TV set. There's like three hundred people yelling. And lights, camera action.

[01:31:46] Sue Bryce | And she's gonna turn to you at one point and ask the question, and you better deliver this line, so practice it. And I had 3 lines, 3. And I was just like, nervous as hell. And I was like, waiting, and I did the whole thing. I'm on stage.

[01:32:00] Sue Bryce | She asked my first question, oh, then they told

[01:32:01] Jen | me this. If you take too long to answer, she will step on you. And I was like, what does that mean? And they're

[01:32:02] Sue Bryce | like, it basically is like this. So you do this, don't you? Yes, I do. And it's something that I've always enjoyed, but I'm taking too long. And as soon as I take a breath, she's like, thanks.

[01:32:13] Sue Bryce | So now if we look over here and and she stepped on me, the first line I thought I shot it out there fast. I'll tell her, I'm gonna see her, no, get it out there, and she still stepped on me. And I was like, Oh, didn't get the footage to second line. So then I was like, a deer in headlights. And I was like, I'm gonna get the second one.

[01:32:36] Sue Bryce | I'm gonna get the second one. And then the second one came, and I was just like, oh, And I was just like, I got it out. I got the whole thing out. And I did a fake smile, and then I was like, and then I got off, and I was just like, that was horrible and weird. And she stepped on me, and I was talking fast.

[01:32:53] Sue Bryce | But what you learn is media training, and the media training is this, no matter what they ask you out there, what is the objective to come back to my film is? My new film is years, you know, making this film was so difficult, you know, you're bringing it back to the main point of the interview every single time. And I was just like, you've got to learn all of that stuff. That takes a lot, and that's really interesting. But, yeah, if you take too long to say it, they just step on you, but it's all about that positioning.

[01:33:23] Sue Bryce | And you know, there's so many things that you can learn about that, but

[01:33:26] Jen | as a Boudoir photographer, I have a hard time networking because I'm afraid of how people will react to it.

[01:33:29] Sue Bryce | Wow, I don't even know what to say to that. Maybe you should go and do something else. Seems weird that you would be afraid to do show the one

[01:33:45] Jen | beautiful thing you do.

[01:33:45] Sue Bryce | I would call it something different than Biba is such a gross word. It's a it's just such a gross word. It's like the word buber, mate, but it's not it. It's like moist. Sorry.

[01:34:06] Sue Bryce | Call it empowering

[01:34:08] Jen | women and their nippers. I

[01:34:12] Sue Bryce | didn't know. What can you say? You can't be worried about what other people are gonna say about you, or what they're gonna say about your genre. You gotta own that stuff. You gotta own it so much that when someone does criticize you in front of people, you could be like, yep, that's me.

[01:34:34] Sue Bryce | Just a dirty old boobah photographer. Like, own it. Why wouldn't you own it? I, I owned glamor photography, like, when I first

[01:34:43] Jen | started telling everybody, and by the

[01:34:43] Sue Bryce | way, why did you tell everyone you were a glamor photographer? Nobody else was a glamor photographer. It was the most interesting thing you could say at a party. I'd be like, I'm a glamor photographer, and people would go, like, like, 90s glamor. Gross.

[01:34:59] Sue Bryce | And they'd make a face, and I'd go, yeah, but it looks like this. And I'd show the card in my pocket, and they'd all go So to

[01:35:08] Jen | me, I used a negative in a positive way. You can almost throw it in people's faces

[01:35:17] Sue Bryce | I photograph women naked in their underwear, dancing on beds, and men too, naked in their underwear dancing on the bed if that's what they want. Like, you've gotta, like, go into what what you think is the worst thing. And make it okay. It's like when you think I can't start this business because of this one thing, did anybody have a thing that they that trip them up for a while? Okay.

[01:35:40] Sue Bryce | Mine I didn't wanna put my out there as an international instructor because I didn't like the way I looked at the time, and I gave myself a stupid hurdles around that. But the truth is, as you find out, that the thing that stopped you from doing it first place ends up being the most powerful thing about you. The thing that stopped

[01:35:59] Jen | you when you own it became the one thing that makes people understand you. It's like when it's finding out your greatest weakness

[01:35:59] Sue Bryce | is actually your superpower. And that's, you know, I had 2 I had 2 weaknesses that were stopping me, and they both became my superpower, and it's so weird that they were both my weaknesses. Yeah. And that's a good, and Eva just said, why don't you do a talk on body positivity or aging or, you know, self value or, you know, just self esteem? We have the ability to relate any talk and relate our business and who we are to what it is that drives us and makes us feel purposeful.

[01:36:45] Veronica | Do you have a way, or how do you determine how much you charge for a speaker fee?

[01:36:49] Sue Bryce | Okay. So speakers don't get paid. They really don't.

[01:36:54] Jen | Like, in the photo industry, you get $500, and they'll pay for 1 night of your hotel or maybe 2, and maybe $500 towards

[01:36:54] Sue Bryce | your flight. But they want you to bring all of your audience. So it's like, we'll give you no money, but we're giving you the stage. So one of the most interesting things if you're gonna start speaking regularly in your industry is you gotta have something to sell afterwards,

[01:37:21] Jen | because otherwise you're not getting paid. And often, the 1st year of, speaking on stages, I sponsored myself. I paid my own flights in

[01:37:22] Sue Bryce | my own hotel, I did not take any sponsorship. And when people said, oh, you're everywhere right now, you're on all these stages, I was paying for that because I didn't have a sponsor, I would just take photoshoots in the area of wherever I was going, and I traveled the world doing that for 4 years honing my content just out there teaching people fully self sponsored. See, a lot of the time, when you own a stage or a platform, people are like, I wanna talk on your platform. I wanna speak on your stage, they're like, cool. What have you got?

[01:38:01] Sue Bryce | And they go, well, I haven't prepared anything. Can't you just choose me to speak on your stage? And I was like, to say what? Show me a talk. And I might pick you for my stage, but most people tell me they're ready for stage before they tell me they've got content.

[01:38:16] Sue Bryce | In fact, everyone does. And then the ones that do get their content out, I let them take the next steps, but they've gotta I then charge them to go and maybe you should go and write a couple of keynotes, and then send them to me so that I can see them. And then they're like, oh, oh, okay. Oh, Alright. Okay.

[01:38:33] Sue Bryce | I'll go and do that. And I was like, yeah, you go and do that. And I just realized that it, a lot of people are, I like, ready to take the step towards the stage, but they haven't actually curated content around it or what they're gonna talk about or what their niche is, or what their superpower is and it starts with that just being able to present your business because all I'm ever really doing in my own industry is presenting my business to other people in my industry to show them how I do it. And like I said, I'm going to most of the people in the room will want to be me or walk my path and the ones that think that I'm below them, I empowered everyone. That's all Ava did, was empower everyone in the room.

[01:39:12] Sue Bryce | Just what you're there for. Alright. I wanna see a lot more marketing talks. Come on, man. Get brave.

[01:39:19] Sue Bryce | Get out there. Get out there as a speaker. Help people. You have the power to help people. Like, is this more than just like All my life, I was told to shut up.

[01:39:37] Sue Bryce | I have a speaking disorder. I can't stop talking. I'm a rapid talker. I'm talk under fire. I talk underwater.

[01:39:46] Sue Bryce | And my whole life, I was told that I talk too much. And it's so funny that now that's what I get paid to do. But nobody pays you to just talk. They pay you for the information you give. And when

[01:40:02] Jen | you give information and you truly just get up there and

[01:40:08] Sue Bryce | just just authentically teach what you know, it comes back

[01:40:14] Jen | to tenfold. Tenfold. My business was booked for 5 years, booked solid once I started speaking.

[01:40:14] Sue Bryce | I could get off the stage, and meet a hundred people in line, and I would wait the 2 hours to do that, to meet every person, to talk to each one. I sold every product I took to talks, gained a following, fully booked my studio in every sense, just by standing up in front of people and showing them what I do and how I do it. And it's so powerful. And you don't think you're important, and you don't think you have something good to say, and you don't think that you can do it, and yet you are more powerful than most of the people sitting in that room, and you can help all of them if you just get up there and think about the one thing that they really need right now, and that's just some advice or some great tips to change their business. And if you need to know more, you can come and talk to me afterwards.

[01:41:10] Sue Bryce | Thank you so much. It's been wonderful to talk with you tonight. See? Just get out of there.

[01:41:16] Veronica | What is the first step in getting speaking opportunities

[01:41:20] Sue Bryce | do this. Present your business. If you can't present your business, you're not gonna get any speaking opportunities. 2nd, do content curator. Curate your content so you know how and what you're going to say, and then you can do the speak work shop, but that's an in person workshop, and that's when you're ready to stand up on the stage before you've got to get through the preliminary, which is what am I gonna say?

[01:41:44] Sue Bryce | And that process is really truly just finding all of the gold nuggets that you already have and then realizing they are valuable to every single person sitting in the room.

[01:41:53] Veronica | I'd like to reiterate that in doing content curator and really developing what it is that you want to do showing up to your networking events, prepared with what it is that you want to speak on, then you start getting invited at those events, at those networking events because you're prepared with all of this.

[01:42:10] Sue Bryce | Yes. And all industries have conferences that you can apply to, but what people don't realize is like WPPIs are much, people will start calling me now, and going, Hey, Thu. Like, I was just thinking I could talk at WPPI. Is there any room for me? I was like, they chose them last March.

[01:42:27] Sue Bryce | Like, guys, you're at a conference, you're a year out. You're applying for next year. If the conference is right in front of you. This is what you need to understand. Every conference has somebody who chooses their speakers, find out who that is.

[01:42:41] Sue Bryce | It's not what you know. It's who you know. And if somebody can give you an introduction, you are 10 steps ahead. This is coming from someone that owns online platforms, and a stage, and a conference. Do you know how hard it is to find good speakers?

[01:43:00] Sue Bryce | Every year. Every year. They would come to me and they go, come on, Sue, you gotta get me 12 speakers. And I'm like, I've I've got 6. You know?

[01:43:13] Sue Bryce | People aren't putting themselves out there to do it. They're talking about it. Like, I want to do this, but they're not actively creating a speaker brand. They're not creating that sales page. We're speaking on it.

[01:43:24] Sue Bryce | They're not doing a speaker reel. So I've found a speaker reel. Guess what? I keep saying to people, if you wanna build a speaker brand, you need a speaker reel, you need a 10 minute example, I've got an example of me talking for 10 minutes on stage at the portrait masters in 2019. One of my favorite talks, it's beautiful.

[01:43:46] Sue Bryce | It's a 10 minute slot. Now I'm editing a quick 3 minute speaker real version. And I go online last night, and I was like, let's have a look at some speaker reels. I did not find good speaker reels, so I guess I'm gonna have next week. I'll be doing that, but right now I found one good one and Kellen's gonna play it for us.

[01:44:08] Sue Bryce | And it's just I don't know who this dude is. Caitlin just sent me a speaker real and said, do you like this guy's speaker real? And I was like, oh, interesting. So have a look at this.

[01:44:19] Ben | I'd love to tell you a story. It's a story about how a simple bucket list actually changed my life forever.

[01:44:31] Jen | Resan just walked out. I was in the prime of my life, and I was very happy.

[01:44:46] Ben | But anxiety caused me to have trouble sleeping. And ultimately, this lack of sleep, this constant pressure that I put on myself, it all contributed to me sliding into a depression. Everything that I've worked so hard for my entire life has suddenly gone. Then I decided to make a shift. I started talking about what I was going through for the first time to my friends, and I realized I wasn't the only one that was going through some of these feelings.

[01:45:12] Ben | I wasn't alone. So we decided to pose this question to ourselves. What do you wanna do before you die? We have all these things that we wanna do, but we haven't done them because they're buried. And we have these in our lives where we're inspired to go after those things, but the day to day barriers them.

[01:45:31] Ben | Life gets in the way. And so we just decide to make the most epic bucket list of all time. That one small decision would completely change the rest of my life. These list items, I was convinced they were impossible. Slowly, they started to fall off the list.

[01:45:52] Ben | Have a beer with Terry. Be interviewed by Oprah. Make a TV show. Write a number 1, New York Times bestseller. Tell a judge you want the truth?

[01:46:03] Ben | You can't handle the truth? And then we thought every time we cross something off our list, let's help a stranger

[01:46:10] Jen | we meet cross something off their bucket list. When you help someone else, you don't

[01:46:10] Ben | just help that one person. You help the people around them. Right? You help their family. You help their friends.

[01:46:27] Ben | That creates a ripple effect. Now this idea of a ripple effect is very powerful because it proves that one person can create an incredible impact. So remember this within your teams, right, with your clients, each small gesture of gratitude, each helping hand, every time you go

[01:46:43] Jen | above and beyond

[01:46:43] Ben | creates this invisible ripple hard to measure, but it's very real.

[01:46:49] Jen | And we keep our dreams alive.

[01:46:56] Ben | We all have to take care of our mental health just like we have to take care of our physical health. That allows us to be version of ourselves, and then we can perform, and we can thrive. And one way we get energy from our life is by doing those things that we love, following those passions, taking those moments that fuels us, that fires us up, that gives energy. And then we can deploy that energy in any way that we wish. So this is the new leadership.

[01:47:22] Ben | By you putting yourself first, you put yourself in a position to serve others. So it's not selfish. It's actually service. I'm hoping that you're starting

[01:47:30] Jen | to see how following

[01:47:32] Ben | these goals have a huge impact in what you do here every day. So what I wanna leave you with is a simple process to achieve any big goal. I call these the 5 steps to make the impossible

[01:47:47] Jen | possible. This whole thing is all about coming back to who you truly are because when you are who you

[01:47:55] Ben | are, you're more powerful.

[01:48:11] Sue Bryce | Okay. What did we see there? He's a corporate speaker, and he's got an agent. That's why he's getting those big talks, but his testimonials were one liners, mostly, mostly one liners, and they were big companies, FedEx, Kellogg's. Okay.

[01:48:25] Sue Bryce | It was a little bit longer because it has to have speaking content in it. The point of that is, obviously, if I'd never met him and looked at his social, I can gauge a lot of energy from him, by what he's doing. I also understand speaking and video. So the first thing that connected to me, which may not might not connect with you guys, although a lot of you had TV and video, oriented as well, would be that when a stand up comedian does a Netflix special, they've already done that stand up 200 times, right? So they've repeated the same talk and only changed the jokes to get them more funnier.

[01:49:05] Sue Bryce | By the time they do the stand up special, they've already done that keynote.

[01:49:08] Jen | A 90 minute keynote, usually around seventy

[01:49:09] Sue Bryce | times, unchanged in that final, you know, I saw Jerry Seinfeld first to, trip on the tour, and then I saw his Netflix special 18 months later, and it was 80% what that first one was. He changed 20% of it and got to a Netflix special. So I can tell one thing. He's done the same talk at multiple different events, because he could stitch the narrative together, the same narrative it was the same narrative. Now, I hate that.

[01:49:46] Sue Bryce | Because as a conference owner, that's cookie cutting to me because I was like, oh, you gave the same talk five times. That's what I saw there. That that's just something I flag because that also is just It's a great way to make a speaker real, is that he did the same talk multiple times, because it gave such a different when it changed to the graduation. The testimonials were in there. He was being positioned constantly the testimonials were very much this talk was in alignment with our brand.

[01:50:18] Sue Bryce | Did you see that? It was very the words were chosen carefully.

[01:50:22] Jen | They weren't long testimonials. They were

[01:50:22] Sue Bryce | one statement. They were also He used the branding the way of writing the

[01:50:30] Jen | font and the brand of whatever was being used, which is smart because he's a

[01:50:30] Sue Bryce | big company. Did anybody get his name? And did you write it down when you saw the name? So you saw it and then wrote it down?

[01:50:46] Jen | At the end.

[01:50:47] Sue Bryce | So I did not write down his name, and I couldn't tell you what his name was. I didn't write it down. Soon as you said Ben, I said, oh, that's right. It was Ben, but I did not get a name in there, which was really, really interesting. So, but yeah, isn't that cool?

[01:51:02] Sue Bryce | So now I'm gonna go and study more speaker reels. So That's the kind of video that you could make for your sales page, but instead of a speaker reel, it could literally be you doing what you do, like a craft video, a business video, a brand story, a business story. Those are not hard to do. They take time and a little bit of extra cost, or if you're gonna outsource it, or if you're gonna DIY it, you have to, you know, learn these skills, but it's really interesting. But I really like that, and I'm so glad Kate sent that to me because that's something really cool.

[01:51:35] Sue Bryce | And now I'm gonna cut my speaker real, because I've got just a talking one, and I've got like a social media one that's just fast, but now I need to blend them together and create a narrative throughout it. So, yeah, I'm really excited to do that. Look, I'm a professional speaker. I study speakers. I teach speaking, but the one thing I want to teach you is this is not this is the the hardest thing to do.

[01:52:03] Sue Bryce | If you can get up and do this, you can talk in front of 3000 people. Talking in front of 25 people and 3000 people is no different. In fact, it's easier to talk to 3000. Do you know why? When you're in front of 3000 people, you can't see them.

[01:52:20] Sue Bryce | You just feel this collective energy. When you're in front of 25 people, you can see them, smell them, Here, you could see somebody in the room's not having as good a time as the other nineteen people are. It's really more intimate. It's actually harder. It's more personalized.

[01:52:43] Sue Bryce | When you get that big sea of people, it's just that energy, and it feels really unique. So it's like such a thing, being able to stand up and speak about my business. I even have a hilarious story about the first time I went networking. Remember that? The packet of cigarettes and the pie.

[01:52:59] Sue Bryce | Oh my gosh. I left the networking event. I have to tell it story again Monday. Sometimes I think about those stories, and I'll say, you all remember that, don't you? But yes, work your way through that list.

[01:53:13] Sue Bryce | Work your way through that last list. It's a good one and really start to curate and get some confidence. Fill yourself up with that power and get up there and start talking because it's a really cool thing to do, and it will change your world. Thank you for joining me again for another 2 hour session. Talk to me in the group, guys.

[01:53:32] Sue Bryce | And if there's no more questions, I'll leave it at that.

[01:53:35] Veronica | One more question. It was, do you recommend that you have a team that's doing these videos if you don't have the talent?

[01:53:42] Sue Bryce | Say again?

[01:53:43] Veronica | So if you don't have the talent to create the videos yourself, the speaker reels yourself

[01:53:47] Jen | Okay.

[01:53:48] Sue Bryce | It's not a talent. It's a skill. Okay. Some people are very talented at shooting videos, but it's just a skill. If it's not a skill, you have outsource it.

[01:53:58] Sue Bryce | If it's not a skill you want to learn, outsource it. I say that to everyone, outsource everything you hate doing. There's somebody out there that literally loves doing the jobs you hate doing. Like, they love it. So weird.

[01:54:12] Sue Bryce | Thank you very much. Go put yourself out there. Get in front of people.
