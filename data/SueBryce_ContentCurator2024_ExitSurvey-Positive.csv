I hoped this workshop would help me organize my thoughts and put my ideas into action.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",Learning simple processes to create that work and can be applied by anyone to anything they desire to create.,Can't think of any at the moment,I think Content Curator is great
"In an effort to breathe new life into my 12-year-old business, I decided to turn to content creation and yet, I kept stalling. I needed a system to get going, an authority to coach me, and a community to back me up and saw that Content Curator had all three. It seemed like the universe was sending me a sign (or else, it was Craig Swanson :)","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",Content Curator gave me both a deeper understanding how to approach content creation and the coaching and encouragement to take the first steps to get started.,"I felt that Sue want off-script regularly, making her hard to follow and the related take-home points unclear. I can see that is her style but as someone who is accustomed to more formal learning, it made it hard to connect the dots unless I went back and re-watched the recordings. Sometimes I had to do that several times, and I felt that time could have been better spent over the course of the six weeks if I actually focused on the exercises. For example, I have yet to do the timeline and bones and now when I finally do it, I will have missed the live coaching where I could have asked questions and a richer understanding of the content. What good is the content if you don't do the related exercises? Also, some word choices are not obvious, eg: what is a vertical? Maybe I should look up that word in a kiwi dictionary. ;-) But there is a benefit too: I am an educator and a coach and I have a greater appreciation of why it's important to teach using clear and concise language, well organized for the learner/client. Thanks for the opportunity, Craig! - Michelle","I think Content Curator is Sue's branded language and it's close enough to Content Creator to be recognizable. Since Sue speaks to that audience and it could be off-putting to those like me who aren't, she could niche down to attract photographers and other artsy types. If so, you could add an adjective like, ""Creative Content Curator."" From a marketing standpoint, our head tends to recognize concepts better when anything like words in this instance, come in threes. I will recommend this course to my content creating friends who are photographers and other creative professionals, and so will be sure to tell them to look up Sue Bryce and not ""Content Curator"" thx!"
I want to become a speaker,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",The speaker roadmap is exactly what I was looking for.,I couldn't keep up with all the weekly modules. Maybe an option for a slower track?,I keep calling it Content Creator rather than curator.
I originally signed up to learn more about creating a workshop (for clients). Sue's enthusiasm for creating content was contagious and opened my mind to so many options,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","It has more than helped. Writing my 3x3 encouraged me to think big, but not huge, so I wrote photographer, storyteller and writer. As I wrote in a post in the group, shortly after putting out into the universe I want to be a writer, an author/producer/wealth manager reached out to me (I met her at a networking group six years ago and she had been following my work) and asked if I wanted to be a part of an anthology of professionals who can help a woman going through divorce rediscover her mojo. So I said YES! Between that coaching and CC, I have all the tools I need, and I just finished writing my chapter already.","oops, I wanted to continue the previous question. When Sue laid out her brainstorm for templates, that gave me an idea for a video series.  Then one of the coaches in the book writing program asked what kind of lead magnet I wanted to create, and when I shrugged my shoulders she said I can see you creating a short video demonstrating some of the things you talk about in your chapter. That was a perfect tie in to the template video series idea that Sue had planted. THEN, I realized all this leads up to the workshop that I want to create. So YES, this has been very helpful, because it does seem possible to someday add Workshop Leader/Facilitator to my 3x3. What I would find helpful are more examples. Beyond Sue's story, which is magical, maybe show us how to turn 20 bullet points into 20 titles in a variety of areas. And also explain what a vertical is. For those of us not in the biz world this is a vague concept. Also, some examples of heart narrative. Examples help the content go deeper. Hope this helps!","Oh, that's a tough one. I'll let you take the lead on that. Good luck!"
I signed up to move into my teaching and speaking opportunities in a new (yet familiar) direction with clarity and confidence in having the details worked out.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","This is such a dynamic, clear course compared to the Beta.  It is a great foundational course that helped me put the pieces together for the finale of my career.  I always wanted to build a course but didn't quite get the steps clear in my mind.  The maps are brilliant, the education is really about exploring where we are, what we know and where our mastery is, giving us an outline of the opportunities available.  I have been able to do each step along with what is taught each week to prepare for a sponsored webinar that is the basis for a future course on the branding process with an emphasis on a visual library and how to use it.  Content is pouring out of me!  So far I have been able to figure out all the steps and add to them my speaking experience, marketing and networking abilities to make this beta webinar on Friday a success.  I have 20 people signed up!  I have enthusiastic reposts with recommendations of the announcement of the webinar!  It's been a commitment on my part to keep up and apply the course in real time including building the landing page, writing the bones then the content for the webinar along with a workbook and a giveaway for one lucky winner that I can also sell.    I am now preparing a landing page for the course waiting list.  Kinda scared but also excited and overflowing with brilliant content ideas that I am most enthusiastic about!  I was ready for this course, I am excited for the other students as I listen to the steps they are taking for their journey.  I keep saying it's all so exciting, I am lit up like fireworks!  I am so grateful for the education in this course.  With photography and self value I had several mentors along with Sue but with content creation, I may have met many educators on course creation but have not met anyone who can teach this one so well.   Everyone on her team has my gratitude especially to Sue for this course.  Mahalo, Thank You and Muchas Gracias!","It has worked well for me because I am very good at filling in the blanks.  But I can see some struggle with the details.  Technical like an audio setup.  Taking each step in order, for example trying to make a speaker reel without understanding the context.  Maybe emphasize doing a beta test of speaking while it's being recorded from beginning to end with testimonials to have content to create the reel.  A checklist with each Map, a do this then that.  Emphasis on how how each step prepares you for the next step.  More detail, I guess.  An FAQ with each lesson.  I'd also like a little more feedback.  I'm doing the work, I'm confident in my materials but a little more feedback to be sure I'm on the right track.  But then, doing the thing and seeing the results is the best feedback, right?  I am definitely prepared to do the thing, let's see what the feedback and results are!",Content Creator.  My biggest lesson is learning that I can create a course.

"I was asked to present a class for ASP,  my local guild and TPPA.

To get a better understanding of the process of the business side of photography.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I'm woefully behind in the videos and workbooks, but it's given a great level of insight into what it takes to get the ball rolling, and to keep it rolling. 
I've been wracking my brains when it comes to what kind of digital service/product I could offer, but what I keep coming back to, is seeing Sue scream into the camera ""BUT, DO YOU LOVE IT? Because if you love it, you can sell it.""","I'm still having issues with trying to access the Skool side of things, so I can take advantage of asking the community questions to help me.",Sell What You Love.
I am creating an online course,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I just love all of Sue's teachings, pdfs etc. She helped me get over limiting beliefs, build confidence, inspire etc.",I would love printed materials or workbook mailed.,
"I was seeking something like this, as I was heading to a Content Creator path, and everything that was coming to me did not feel right or fit my sensibilities. I was SBE member 2018/19 and drifted away. I haven't seen anything Sue Bryce related since. Saw the Facebook ad! Thank you, I needed this! I found some money and was ready :)","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I had many ideas and projects I was/am working on and in the process of building. This helped me so much to sort through it all, find the clarity, make sense of why I was doing what I was doing and walking this path already, I have the tools now to do this over and over. Excited to see how my first ""product"" goes!","Some of the workbook pages I had a hard time wrapping my head around, even while watching the videos. I love a step-by-step method but maybe this is by design to get my brain into seek-the-answer-mode. Because I did eventually figure it out, but how many are just tapping out because they don't get it? I also printed the workbooks out, which was incredibly helpful! I don't know if anyone else did.","I really like Content Curator. But words that might bring in the masses are Monetize Your Content or, Content Creator Career Path.

"I want to create digital content to ""sell while I'm sleeping"" and learn more about the steps how to do this. And I joined the CC because I know Sue kicks me in my butt with what and how she teaches. That helps a lot to see things through.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I have a clear vision what I will create. I've got my creativity, my clarity and my confidence back through CC.",Sometimes it seems complicated. Sometimes I don't get what Sue is trying to say or the meaning of what she says (English is not my first language). Some things make sense at a later point and give me the light bulb. I'm reading through some marketing/human psychology books at the same time - that helps me to understand what Sue says.,Oh I think Content Curator or Creator is a great name
"to learn how to create meaningful content for workshops, podcasts, templates","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",So far it has really helped me organize my thoughts around what i want to teach and sayand make them meaningful for others. This is a big process and i find I need time to digest each segment of Sue's course.,Need a bit more time between week 3 and week 4 to really digest the develoment of ideas stage.

It’s helped so much!","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Excellent blueprint. I especially love the checklists for hosting an in person workshop, etc. The videos are great and then the follow up coaching/discussion is excellent too.","communication of time commitment. As a working mom running my own business I wish I had blocked out at least one day per week in my calendar to devote to working on this content. I’m a bit behind as a result, but have blocked out time next week to commit to finishing what I need to do.",I love content curator
I'm hoping to create content and needed actionable steps to make it happen - Sue is good at that,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","There hasn't been as much focus on practical steps yet (I hope she gets there) but the idea of focusing on your own story and the idea that we can also be speakers in additional to whatever else was inspiring, eye opening and helpful","I do feel Sue is repeating a lot of info. I think a list of tools like website that host content, vendors to use, speaker venues, video reel tips - like how to make them good and actually make them as opposed to just ""make one that reflects who you are"" would be helpful",
Because Sue always has great content and I thought this would be helpful to keep my on my journey but add more value to what I'm already doing,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",It's helped me come up with some more solid ideas for my business model and moving forward with things that I've been working on but wasn't necessarily sure what the next step was.,I think a week gap in between the sessions would be helpful - some of this has a lot of work to the process.,I like the current name
"I signed up because I knew teaching and speaking were my next natural steps after running my business for 14 years! And what Sue (lovingly) yelled at me in Italy last year really stuck with me, that I’m ready to go forward. 
I was hoping to get some real life advice and specifics on everything! And she has been giving more than I expected","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I’ve already started recording my education series, am working on digital products, and looking for speaking gigs! I’ve got several really solid topics that I feel so good about. Mastery level for the win!","Very few. Jen’s workbooks are top notch, and go with the content wonderfully.

I want to start creating content to increase my profit. Start creating a network. Since the first content creator I wanted to enrolled but I didn’t have the money.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","It gives you ideas. How to organize your plans. But I think I need more info. A deepest info. Like for example. How to create a podcast. We need example of the software, a camera, a mic, lights. It doesn’t need to be deep content but at least get the idea. And that’s the same for selling digital products. I think we need a little more info. Go a little bit deeper.","More info as I said before. Tools, softwares. Even coupons in case we buy any software . I think that can be a great addition. I think that is the only piece missing.",I like Content Curator but it can be content curator mind. Ready to content curate. Content creator machine. Haha. I like that one!
"To get some clarity, focus and direction in my business as I relaunch a new business name, and to know what to post for content.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",It helped me see that there is more than one revenue stream available for me.,I  can't think of anything to suggest - Sue is pure gold.,I like the name as it is.
Refine topic(s) to create content.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","It helped me realize I'm not a first-time content creator as I'd initially thought-it's simply my first time doing it FOR me. My entire corporate career was built on creating learning content. This workshop gave me the perspective I needed to see I've been on the right track all along. This entire time I failed to see the value in the content I'm developing because it felt too simple & unsophisticated, only to realize that my success in the corporate world was precisely because it was simple & unsophisticated, making it incredibly easy to understand & adopt.","The visual were a fantastic add. I'd consider incorporating them each week. I would also recommend doing a survey after each online module to capture questions, concerns, comments in preparation for the live.","The name is great, but it got me thinking back to the previous question. I would consider another exercise for capturing tacit content since it seemed like there was confusion among those new to content curation (in the context that you're teaching), specifically around the difference between content curation, content creation, and product creation. Or maybe it's just a matter of differentiating them more clearly as the terms are often synonymously used online. ie: Creating a digital product to some is the same as curating digital content. And content curation to some is the same as creating a product. Hope that makes sense (haha, the irony!)"
Yes I wanted to learn how to grow my brand in different ways I hadn't thought of.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","It's reinforced that I'm on the right path, has provided inspiration, and introduced new ideas...like products I'd already created but can use/sell in different ways.",Nothing that I can think of.,Maybe something around brand impact. Like how your brand can better impact the world.
I want to get a better hold on creating content In general,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",So far it’s just helped me get really clear on what I want to create,I don’t think it’s over yet but I’d love it if we could get more info or insights about filming?,I can’t think of a better one

"I wanted to have clarity on the direction I wanted to go when it came to monetize work the I am already doing, understand how to market it and have the tools and motivation to give it a try and get moving.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Information, walking through steps, getting clarity on what I want to do and Sue is the Oprah of portrait photography, so motivating and inspiring with a dash of ass kicking that is needed.","I definitely fell behind and could not keep up with the homework while working my business.  I think that is more on me than the class.  The one thing that would be most helpful is understanding how to find good help with content creators (the guides, the workbooks, reference material etc.). Most business don't want to share where and how they do things, they act as if they do it themselves when it is obvious they do not.  I think some of this will be provided during this week and next at least I am hoping.  I also inquired several times about being part of the audience and never got that information or response.  Sometimes it is getting access to the people that help you feel supported that is the kick in the pants that propels you.  I also think that some people don't know what their ""superpower"" is, and they see what others are doing and follow along.  Maybe more help with pinpointing what people are good at and where they will be most successful.",I like the name you have....turn your passion into income

Interested on learning new things from Sue,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",Working through areas that I didn’t even know I need clarification to help me with all forms of business across the board.,Definitely more visuals and maybe  more explanation for the timeline I really got stuck there.,I think the name is perfect
I originally signed up for Content Curator to help me create some passive income streams.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Content Curator helped me to fully see and own the value of the service I provide, identify product options, and it provided a step by step process.",A little more time.

I saw the first episode out of curiosity and realised my potential to curate content. I just watched it because it was Sue's workshop and she had literally created my portrait business out of nothing.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",I have chapters of my book and basic content ready and I wasn't even planning to go down this path. But as soon as i realised my natural gift it started coming out effortlessly because of her framework.,"I have always struggled with marketing/getting leads on a larger scale in a way that it feels outside of my core potential. Getting seen or heard on social media when u have no following at all and as an introvert(not being too loud in messaging but meaningful) in midst of so many creators and algorithms changing all the time feels challenging and uphill. It feels like it takes way more time to be seen too. 

If the workshop covers that to make marketing as effortless as creating, while getting some results regularly that fuels my energy constantly, it would be greatly beneficial.",Content Curator feels like a good name. I feel like a tagline would explain more. I wasn't expecting that I would come up with content for a book or workshop out of this. I thought it was going to be about developing content for posting on social media.
"i build an educational platform now, and i learn from Sue since 2012, so I trust her educational system","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","For the first two weeks, that is strongly meaningful work, to come bake to essentials, to re-know WHY i do this, and all the value i bring to the world. And for me, having a step by step system/plan is very useful.","I take the time for now. I hope to find step by steps, specific topics about every content, fear points (like mine - technical stuff scares me...), and may be son exchanges with some other curators who has different caracter than Sue's, another kind of passion about projects, ... euh less action-persons... you see waht i mean ?!

Yes. I needed help sorting passive income streams and getting them off paper and into reality.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","The thorough treatment of multiple content types, how to build them, and how to execute them is exactlywhat I was looking for.

It'd make remote learning a lot easier.,"Nothing brilliant comes to mind, but a subtitle addressing the soup to nuts approach to content curation might be useful, in terms of attracting new students/clients."
"I was at TPM for the first time this year, & really enjoyed Sue talking about the verticals in her business. This felt like a building block to add to that knowledge, and my gut instinct told me to sign up. I have been in & around photography and WPPI for 16 years and have always wanted to speak- but never felt confident enough or worthy enough. I didn’t know where to start. This was the course I didn’t know I needed.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I wasn’t entirely sure of what “content curator” would involve- at first I thought it was just a social media class or something- but being able to focus on the bones of what we know, and having solid steps to create has been a game changer. I am so excited to immerse myself in creating and mining all of the information I have contained within me.","I really liked the format. I didn’t have the full picture of what the course was about from the name- a few of my friends at WPPI thought it was a social media class also. In a way, I guess it could be but it was so much more than that. I also really appreciated having the course take place not in a Facebook group, because there are too many distractions on that platform. Over all, I really enjoyed this program and I guess the benchmark for its success will be how many of us implement it & show up teaching and creating. I know I am going to.","That is a tough one- because having been through the program now, content curation is actually the goal. Perhaps the name doesn’t have to change but it just may have a different subtitle or description."
I wanted to receive help and guidance in creating and launching a new area of business / revenue building.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","The first three weeks, deep diving into the 3x3, the areas of content that I know and how to see it translate into other areas of business / revenue.","Give more time between classes, especially as we begin to really shape, beta test and launch.  Sometimes, the ""gift of knowledge"" focuses at a much higher level than for someone truly coming this for the first time.","I wouldn't rename the couse per se, but add a tag line of what it is / does ...""Connecting the content you know to the people that need to grow from it"" or something like that."
I have multiple digital products and courses I want to create.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Learning how to go step by step to build it out properly was key. Having content dropped out so I couldn’t watch it all at once was so helpful for my adhd. I was able to be in audience for week 4 and immediately booked flights to attend weeks 5 and 6 because it was so helpful. I love that there are so many taps and tracks and Sue teaches how to build out each one so they are in support of each other. Really, it was the bite sized structure I needed!",There were a couple of places where I got stuck on homework and it bottlenecked me moving to next stage. After speaking to other students I was able to sort it out.,I like the name!
"I already have the products and and materials I want to sell/teach. I joined to get more information about refining those products as well as distribution, marketing, and monetization.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Content Curator has given me so many new ideas about how to develop and distribute my content (ebooks, podcast, physical products), along with ways to refine them so they can be more appealing to my audience. While content curation is like starting a whole new business (in many cases it IS a new business), this course has really helped me wrap my arms around WHY I want to do this. 
It helped me realize that I previously put the cart before the horse in several of my product launches and it has given me a roadmap to do it ""right"" the next time. 
I think there are two levels of students: those that have already developed content and want to grow, and those that are learning about how content helps their existing business. This new version of the course has ALL the information needed for both types of students, but you have to know which one you are before you start to really get the most out of it. This is NOT a course for overnight success, but it WILL help you create content that feels the most authentic and connected to YOUR brand, which will then give it a better chance of success. I'm really glad I signed up!","Since I went through the beta, it's hard for me to answer without a level of bias. This new version is so much more comprehensive and laid out so well with the guides and homework. It's really impressive. 
If I were to make any changes at all, it would be to better define tracks for the different levels of student. Level 1 would be for students that are just getting started. (Weeks 1-3) 
Level 2 would be for students that are already speaking, or selling and want more ""inside baseball"" on how to succeed with what they have. (Weeks 4-6)
This could easily be divided into two separate courses like a 101 and a masterclass.
If I came into this without having gone through the beta, I would have felt really overwhelmed at the pace of the material. 
What I've seen are students that want to jump ahead and just get to the monetization without having gone through the necessary steps to internalize the What and Why of their content. They want the How right now, and that's not how this works. That part of the process takes a LOT longer than 6 weeks to do right and I think that point could be emphasized more to help manage expectations.
But the community message board has been an awesome addition in letting the students help each other.

I have wanted to level up my game and expand my income potential but never knew exactly where to start.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",I am working my way back through each video and filling out the homework as I go. So far content curator is amazing at walking through the steps not only to create but to deep dive into what I really want. I am so excited for what the future holds for me! This was exactly the steps and kick in the butt I needed.,"Some parts of the homework I am not sure I exactly understand what it is asking me to do or decide. The ethos is one of them. I also started the workbook for all the things I want to create but quickly decided it works better if I use it for only one at a time, but sometimes I feel like I am back to listing all the things. Not sure how, but would be awesome if it could work for multiple genres of products/speaking/digitals while also asking for whole life goals. It is great, though, to have a tool that we can follow for implementing new exciting avenues for success.",I actually love content curator - it perfectly describes the course and what it helps us through.
1) because it’s Sue Bryce and I’ve been out of the photography realm for about 4 years but she was one of the most massive influences in my life back from the first Creative Live…and 2) because the timing couldn’t be any better. The course description literally spoke to my soul to a tee for where I was at and what I was feeling. And I loved the fact she crossed over applying to other businesses (I have now been an ADHD coach since 2020 working under someone else but I have so so much to give and ready to fly on my own. Just not sure where to start and how to get it all out of my head into intentional content),"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Content Curator was EXACTLY what I needed at the exact time. I feel like Sue is speaking directly to me. (Even right down to me not wanting to use my name as my personal brand and she gave me the permission to do it…or she gave me the courage to give myself permission, really) The way she delivers content keeps me captivated, fires me up and gives me motivation. It blows my mind how many parallels already exist (like the way she brain dumps/mind maps that way. I wish I could show her my notes from over the years!) Those things give me validation to what I’m already doing. Or naming things I didn’t have a name for (I spend a lot of time in the Multiverse!) Then the fresh ideas, where I am learning something new feel deeply aligned.  I didn’t have a way to get the content out of me and now I’ve been driving around thinking about my timelines and my story and getting it engrained in me. 
I think the most important thing that I’m taking away is ACTION",More peer connection - I’m not sure if this is logistically feasible but maybe small accountability groups/co working sessions. A place where we can see others “face to face”. (ie. Zoom) I find verbal processing always brings out so much and listening to others. I love that Sue is so engaging and speaking to me. I feel the disconnect from others though.Something above and beyond the live chat/Skool. It would be amazing to have sub-coaches/mentors (um I would love to be one hehe). Some way that fosters more connection with others who are doing the same work. Oh! And also a way that saves progress on the video. When you exit and come back it doesn’t save. That’s minor but thought I would mention it :),Hmmm have to think on that
"I am ready to start teaching online, hosting workshops and speaking. I signed up for this because Sue taught me the steps to creating a profitable, sustainable portrait studio so I am now turning to her to teach me the steps to content creation and teaching online.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",The timeline exercise has been so helpful and I have a better sense of it now. The homework is helping me map things out. Sue is also so inspirational and her way has put a fire under me to create. I was in the Beta test but this round is hitting home more for me and making a lot more sense to me. Maybe it's that I really ready this time.  But the teachings + the homework + the live coaching is really helping me formulate what I want to create.,This time around has really been great.,Becoming an Educator
"I had a lot of heart lead content, my story and sharing my voice authentically. but I did not know how to convert myself into a professional, a leader in my field. I also have a lot of old content.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",This course helped me connect my heart to my experience to a sellable product.,"clear step by step instructions on what to ""complete"" before watching the next video. I created a forum post about this.",Content Creator: Turn your story into a product
I want to create multiple income streams without physically being in front t of my client (like with photography),"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","First of all, Sue Bryce is so inspiring and delivers the material so well. Second, I am connected with other creatives through this course and building a tribe where we all can support each other on this content creation journey. Lastly, I have the feeling that I can do it with the help of this course. I am excited!!!",I think keeping the courses and community available to us indefinitely would help us very much!,"I like the name as it is, drew me in and wanted to sign up"
To give me direction and help me get clarity abotu the steps I need to take in my content creation journey.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Im only half-way through, but I love listening to Sue speak, and doing the homework is helping me get the content out of my head and onto paper.",I love it how it is. It resonates with me.,I think the name is good
"I signed up in 2022 to the beta test course  (which I didn’t actually realise was a beta group) because I knew I wanted to move into coaching/training/. Whatever Sue does is off incredible value (info, motivation and money wise) so it was a no brainer to sign up to this new version.
Was it what I was hoping for? No… I thought it would be a much more practical course showing me what to do and exact steps to do it. Was I disappointed about this? No…it has taken me on a better path. 
This latest course is equally as good as the beta one….I am saying this from a photographer who has followed Sue for years point of view…Sometimes I think I find myself thinking that if I was a reiki healer or a real estate agent, who had signed up, never having heard of Sue, I might have zero clue what was going on. But I am loving it!","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Yes it has helped massively. 

In terms of helping, Sue has given me so many tips and great bits of advice and things to think about.  She has motivated me and inspired me. I feel like I could be on that stage at TPM…in fact I'd love to do a course for TPM. 
I think that unlike other courses (including SBE) the course feels more like university than high-school type learning/teaching.
In high-school (is that what it’s called in USA?….for teenagers) you get spoon-fed information and led down a specific “do this, then this, and now this” path…..at Uni you are given pointers and have to use your own initiative and learn more for yourself. It's about self development and growth. 
I love how Sue is so blunt (even if it’s an answer to my question) there’s no sugar coating and pandering to bloody stupid questions. And she’s hilarious","Really very few changes.... I can't think of any right now....I think there's a need for more of a step by step learning on how to create some of the materials and systems that we need to take things forward. If you are wanting to attract from all areas of businesses then so many people will have no idea how to make something in Canva or how to physically create the content they need. That would be useful for them. I'm not meaning something delivered by Sue. Maybe point them to something like Creative Live, or knowing you, Craig, you are building this platform already. Like SBE for content curators, that have no clue how to make a reel /pdf/set up an online store to sell downloads/do an email list/ write a newsletter/lead generator video. I know quite a bit, as I'm a photographer and have made my own website and always done everything myself, but I'm  still spending hours down a rabbit hole, learning how to make all the elements I need.  So changes to this course...no...but there's a whole other learning system out there that's needed.",I like the name ----I think it's easy to confuse Content Curator with Content Creator (which is what I did if you read my previous answers. I only now realised the difference ) So set up another course called Content Creator and sell it along side this one
I signed up for this workshop because I wanted to learn how to create content to sell.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","This class really helped me get my mind organized, allowed me to get creative without feeling rushed, and showed me where I missed a few steps. I am so grateful for this complete comprehensive course. Thank you Sue!",I think having a live zoom meeting for the participants as a drop in once a week as a study group would be awesome. Not necessarily having Sue in the group but a way we can be walked through where we are stuck.,I like the name it already has.
"I am self-employed, struggle to consider myself an entrepreneur, because I work for companies as freelancer. I so desperately want to create online courses around the topic that matters to me most: communication","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I got valuable marketing insights and how to create my 3x3. The workbooks are valuable for me. I am still at the very beginning, because I could not keep up with the speed you were delivering the content. I also became aware that I do not like to create this e-commerce and setting up the courses (like creating the content though) - so I will have to delegate. Thank you Sue Bryce - wished I could meet you in person.",An entire Question/Answer session with questions sent upfront for Sue to prepare. Would love that.,Awareness Creator
"Because I am in the process of making my first online course, and I want to make it a good one!","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",By giving structure and developing a solid content system. Also: having access to the knowledge on what type of videos worked well with Sue's experience is great.,"Not sure. I haven't finished the entire course yet, so it would not be fair to ask to add certain stuff that might already be in the course, like a little bit about how to do the actual filming of the course.",Master your Message: from idea to a strong message delivery.
Creative ideas to market and showcase my digital products,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",Sure is the best at “no excuses” coaching.  She helped push me to get creative with my why and my messaging,"As much as I love seeing Sue’s beautiful smile (and the pink shirt oddly kept my attention to the screen and not just listening while multitasking), I would recommend having a split screen to follow along with images of the work book pdf that’s available so watching and taking immediate notes on the proper pdf page would be helpful",I think it’s named perfectly for what it provides
I was curious - I absolutely love Sue’s courses so I knew even though creating content wasn’t necessarily in my goals that I would gain valuable business and creative ideas that I could adapt to my own thing.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",It’s helped me think out of the box about possible other streams of income that I never considered.,I’m only on week 4 as have been away - I’m finding the homework very valuable but I’m falling behind in getting through it in a week as I’m so busy with other work. They are excellent I just have to do the course in my own time due to other commitments. If week 5 and 6 include some details about setting up your own website and advice about how to keep your videos safe online etc that would be good!,Content Curator is pretty good - most people think Content Creator so I keep calling it that by mistake
"I wasn't really sure to expect. Though, I know whatever Sue creates it ends up being amazing and should not to be missed when it comes to growing your business.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Over the last 6 weeks I have been on the fence, going back and forth over whether Content Curator was helping me. For so many days I have grown frustrated by the course work, questioning at times if it was making any sense. I would pull it out and put it away again over and over. Putting the time and thought into the work, clarity has set in. I have greater understanding in how to move forward with the maps Sue has given. I am thankful I will be able to continue to use these in any area of creation as I see fit in the future.",I cannot think of any changes at this time.,
I wanted to know more about Content Curation and how I could implement it in my business.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!",The class gave me clarity on Content Curation. I feel that going through the workbook questions and writing has helped me in my business to get in touch with creativity and allowing it to flow through me freely.,"I feel like I need more specific information like what platforms to sell classes, templates, and now going into the 8 ways to make money as an artist I want to know where to sell ect. I want to know more about how to price the different forms of art like Limited Editions, prints ect.",
"The past 7 years, I’ve done many keynote presentations, lighting and editing workshops in Australia, where I am based, and also overseas like WPPI in Vegas, NZIPP in New Zealand, and The Photography Show in the UK. I felt so much joy and satisfaction in sharing my knowledge and experience in the creative part of photography. Also, I’ve been reached out by other photographers who want to step into fine art, build up a business, and make money from selling their artworks. This is the field I have confidence and joy in. This is the reason I signed up.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!","Yes, it helps. I signed up to learn the steps and the directions I need to take. Sue Bryce had a huge impact on my photography business when I joined the Portrait Master in 2016. I am a bit behind the 6 weeks, but I have already received generously valuable information and lots of motivation too.
The most interesting thing I learned is the philosophy behind being a great speaker, besides the technical parts like 'products, selling, delivery, studio gear, and the team we need to have, etc.' Also, the maps and homework assignments she gave made me clear my mind about what kind of content curator I want to be and who my audience is. She asked very important and eye-opening questions which helped me a lot to understand the steps I need to take, the direction, and the practice I need to put into this new business. She literally kicked me out of my comfort zone and made me write it down and clarify it to myself. That's how she helped me. The information and direction I received in this exciting 6 weeks are a lot to digest; however, I feel like it is the beginning of a big wave. There's lots to work on.",Guest speakers,No idea
"I've wanted to take this since the first version of this workshop, but that time wasn't right.","Yes, Content Curator Helped!",Because anything Sue creates is gold. :),"Sue gives, and we willing receive whatever she teaches. Thanks for a wonderful workshop.",Not sure. The title was what drew me in the first time.
I've been interested in creating sellable templates as I've been asked for them by others.,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","It helped show a framework of steps to get organized and sure of what you as a creator is able to offer, before even offering the product.",I just need to do a better job of blocking time to do the work each week,na
Create a product to make more money,"Yes, Content Curator Helped!","I realize I can have 8 different products all bringing revenue into my business I learned how to curate content, and mostly, I learned that I can create an extraordinary and successful personal brand around myself",Shorter videos bite sized,It should be part of PERSONAL BRAND her next workshop
