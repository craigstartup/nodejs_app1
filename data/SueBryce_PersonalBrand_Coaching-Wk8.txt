Coaching Week 8 - 

[00:00:00] Sue Bryce | Hi, everyone. Sarah said

[00:00:02] Sue Bryce | don't clap early. We all clap early. It's our last day together. I know it hard, isn't it? It's like every week that you turn up, and then it's like, oh, I'm not gonna be here next week, but the good thing for me is I get to go and write a whole lot more content.

[00:00:20] Sue Bryce | Today, what I did was I went through all eight keynotes from the 1st 2 days, and then I went through 7 weeks of coaching, and I removed any fluff, and I only left the slide if it was an actionable step that you're gonna take for your business. I kept it in the exact linear flow of how I taught the class so that you can if any of them flag you, you can actually go back to that coaching week or back to that coaching keynote or the first, 8 keynotes. You can go back and deep dive on that if you feel like you need to. But what I really want you to do today is as we go through all of these slides, I'm gonna wrap this up really like in one bow. So from the moment I start talking, I'm not gonna take questions.

[00:00:59] Sue Bryce | Let me get it all out. It might take 30 minutes. But what I'm gonna do is walk through every actionable point that you've learned in this workshop.

[00:01:12] Sue Bryce | So at any time, you can come back to this specific video, hit

[00:01:12] Sue Bryce | play, and there won't be Q and A in there, they want it'll just flow into next step

[00:01:23] Sue Bryce | and next step and next step. And I do want you to do it in linear order unless you get to a step and you

[00:01:23] Sue Bryce | think that's not for me right now. That's not, or I don't want to do it that way, I'll do it differently, or I'm not ready to do this step. Just flag that, and we're gonna focus on all the actionable steps to move forward. So as I was just telling these guys, sitting here, it's more important

[00:01:49] Sue Bryce | to me that you identify what your big next steps are than anything else with this workshop and

[00:01:49] Sue Bryce | then taking actionable steps every single day to make sure

[00:02:01] Sue Bryce | that it's helping your business.

[00:02:01] Sue Bryce | So I'll do this in one big flow, and I want you to mark every slide that you need to work on. You can just give yourself a one word prompt there are a 110 slides in this presentation.

[00:02:17] Sue Bryce | All of them have an actionable point to them. So make sure you mark which ones so that you can come back to those

[00:02:17] Sue Bryce | steps because I want you to start walking those steps and that's really, really important to me. Okay. Let's

[00:02:31] Sue Bryce | get going. Number 1, your your brand is your face value, and we're looking for value and connection. That's what we're looking for.

[00:02:31] Sue Bryce | Mostly, I'm looking for brand clarity I know who I am, I know what I want, I know what I do, and I know who I do it for. That is your brand. Now what do you want for this brand? I made you do the $1,000,000 dream, I made you walk the multiverse. I made you create a vision for yourself.

[00:03:05] Sue Bryce | Now what do you want is the most important thing you can ask as you're building any brand, and I'm not saying what do you want? I'm saying what do you

[00:03:09] Sue Bryce | want. The most incredible part about that, it doesn't obviously require

[00:03:18] Sue Bryce | an answer. Simply acknowledging that you're you're part of the equation, what do I want? I'm in control of this. I can

[00:03:18] Sue Bryce | change this at any time is enough. But when you do this, the $1,000,000 dream, the multiverse, when you create a vision for yourself, I need you to see it. I need you to taste it, and I need you to feel it. Because whatever vision you create for yourself, if you can't see it, taste it, and feel it, you're not connected to it. And if you can't see it, taste it, or feel it, it might mean that your people pleasing somebody else's dream.

[00:03:57] Sue Bryce | So we're gonna nip that in the bud in the first two slides. 1, my brand is what I who I am, and I know who I am, and now I know what I want for this brand, and now I'm going to create a timeline to it. I'm gonna make my goal

[00:04:13] Sue Bryce | so clear and so strong that my next step is to create a

[00:04:13] Sue Bryce | timeline to it and then hold that focus every single day. I'm gonna lock in my 3 by 3 I will change my 3 by 3 every 3 or 4 months. I can change my 3 by 3 to suit any networking room I'm in. I can make it more casual, more conversational.

[00:04:35] Sue Bryce | I can up my 3 by 3. And as I take each

[00:04:35] Sue Bryce | step closer and closer, for instance, when Melissa was writing a book, she did not write author on her 3 by 3 because her book was not written. And I said to her, you're not an author until you've published your book and then you're an author. So then she can put author on her 3 by 3. You're going to change. You're gonna develop.

[00:04:56] Sue Bryce | Your 3 by 3 is gonna change. What is the most important part about your 3 by 3? It's clarity for marketing. It positions you, it's ownership, and it's your identity. And until you can own your identity and really own who you

[00:05:10] Sue Bryce | are, you can't confidently market yourself as a personal brand and your business.

[00:05:10] Sue Bryce | So what you're looking for here is full ownership I hate generic 3 by threes. And inevitably what happened is when people start, it's like, hi, I'm Sue Bryce, and I like photographing timeless legacy portraits and fluffy bunnies and walking on the beach. And it's like, that's great. It didn't position me with a position of power. It didn't say who I am.

[00:05:38] Sue Bryce | It didn't say what I can do for you. It didn't say you're my target. It didn't say how I can change your world or change your life. So make it better. Make it incredible.

[00:05:48] Sue Bryce | This is the ownership of who you are, and you need to start describing yourself with a little bit more value, you know, like the dudes do. Like my mom told me I'm awesome, therefore I am. So you've gotta start stepping up to that 3 by 3.

[00:06:06] Sue Bryce | You need to tell me what is your brand story.

[00:06:06] Sue Bryce | I need to know. What is it? And what's special about you? What's interesting about you? And when if you're a building a brand, whether it's a creative brand or a personal brand or whatever you're building, if you're building something, other people around you that are building a brand, are looking at you for what reason?

[00:06:28] Sue Bryce | What makes you different? What makes what is your superpower? What makes you stand out? What is good about you? And, you know, what did you do?

[00:06:36] Sue Bryce | What did you discover about yourself? What did you

[00:06:38] Sue Bryce | learn about yourself as you're

[00:06:38] Sue Bryce | building this brand? Like, How did you make this? How did you create this? How did you overcome these odds? How did you make this money?

[00:06:47] Sue Bryce | How did you qualify for this? How did you build that? And how that's what I'm interested in, and you don't even see that as important. But if you know your brand story, you know your wife, if you know your wife, you can tell people why you do it, and that's what people connect to. Alright.

[00:07:02] Sue Bryce | Remember when I said, what do your clients aspire to be? So if you look at your brand and your product, when a client looks at you, they aspire to be something. It could be status. It could be, you know, being seen. It could be there's something about what you do that that's what they want.

[00:07:21] Sue Bryce | And you need to find out what they aspire to be because if you speak to what people aspire to be, that's what they want. Like, if I am photographing people and I say, I'm gonna change the way you see yourself. I'm going to change the way you love yourself.

[00:07:38] Sue Bryce | I'm going to change the way you show up in a room, then I'm marketing to what they aspire to be,

[00:07:38] Sue Bryce | more important, more seen, because that's what people want from me. So if you know this, find out when it comes to you and your brand and your product and your service, what do people aspire to be, and more importantly now, what do you inspire to be? Now look at this. What do your clients aspire to be? Market to that.

[00:08:07] Sue Bryce | So if you find out people want to be free, they wanna be youthful, they wanna feel they want self care, that's what they aspire to be. Market to the one thing that they aspire to be. Now when it comes to you, you and this brand, what do you aspire to be in this brand? Because you might not be talking yourself up right now because, you know, you're new at this and you've got imposter syndrome, and you might not be doing it yet even though you're doing it, but you're not quite doing it. And there's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of, you know, identity crisis and a lot of imparts to syndrome.

[00:08:41] Sue Bryce | But if you can tell me what you aspire to be and then embody that, like embody it. So if you wanna be seen as a professional instructor, act like 1, look act like 1, act like you have this knowledge, act like you have this service, act like you have this content, but you need to embody the one thing that you aspire to be, and you need to tell them what they aspire to be because that's your job. So what do you want? What do you want? Remember?

[00:09:15] Sue Bryce | What do you want? Sometimes this does not require an answer. It's just to acknowledge that you have options, you're part of the equation, you're part of the decision making, and you have the power, and no longer Will anybody tell you what you should do with your brand when your gut instinct is telling you not to do it? So no more people pleasing, no more listening to other people's rules, you've gotta make decisions based on what you want, And sometimes all you have to say inside is do I want that? Just to yourself.

[00:09:49] Sue Bryce | You don't have to speak it out loud. Just say do I want that? And if the answer is no in your heart, you have to set a boundary. But it's just the asking. I bet you none of you ask yourself if you really want this.

[00:10:06] Sue Bryce | You know, when you get a difficult client, do you ever ask yourself? Is it worth it? Is this client gonna get better or worse? Is this client gonna drain me? Is this client gonna take away my creativity?

[00:10:17] Sue Bryce | Is this client not gonna give me what I'm worth? Why would I say yes to that? Why? So you have all this power now because nobody is making your brand better or less you are. So now you have to say, I'm the one that has to acknowledge, is this what I want?

[00:10:36] Sue Bryce | Now sometimes you might say yes to something you don't want to, you can ask yourself, do I want this? No, I don't. Can I set this boundary and say no, no, I have to do it? I've said I'm gonna do it. You show up to say you're gonna do what you're gonna do.

[00:10:50] Sue Bryce | But the next time you set a boundary, Okay? And this is so important. I want you to keep asking, what do I want with this brand? What do I aspire to be? How do I wanna feel every day?

[00:11:03] Sue Bryce | What what do how do I want others to see me? How do I want to embody this new role of the owner of this business of this to be this creator, this speaker, this teacher, this influencer? How do I want to show up to that and keep asking the I question

[00:11:21] Sue Bryce | because what you know and what you feel and what you believe is more important than what anybody else can tell you. This is really simple for me.

[00:11:21] Sue Bryce | Full in love with your products. If you don't love your products, you can't tell me about them from a place of love and you can't sell them to me. You cannot sell from guilt and shame. You can only sell from value. So falling in love with the product that you make with your hands is your only goal here.

[00:11:51] Sue Bryce | If you don't love this product and you can't speak about it in a full place of love and joy, you can't sell it. It's not connected to you, period. These are the 8 products that you can focus on right now. Stop procrastinating. What do you want to make?

[00:12:09] Sue Bryce | What do you want to develop? What do you want to build? These are the 8 products you can make in these 8 products is unlimited creative potential. In the multiverse, when you get out of your own way and stopping like, can I do that? You get out of the validation, you get out of the permission.

[00:12:30] Sue Bryce | Once you get out of all of it, you tell me if you can make any of those products. Don't ask if you can make any of them, You tell me what you got. What do you got for merchandise? You got any cool ideas? What have you got for a physical product, a digital service, a physical service?

[00:12:46] Sue Bryce | What have you got as a digital product? Make money while you sleep, friends. Stop asking for permission as to if you can make one of those products and go and make something you're in love with and then sell the hell out of it. Well, you're sleeping. Then then come and say, Sue, I just made $10,000 this month sleeping.

[00:13:11] Sue Bryce | That will make me happy. Stop procrastinating. Stop asking if you're good enough for those and start telling me if you have the content to fill any of those spaces because there is a need for every one of those products and the people that need them are just like you. It comes down to multiple revenue streams. There's a very high profile multimillionaire speaker on Instagram going right now on a real going.

[00:13:43] Sue Bryce | Multiple revenue streams. The stupidest advice I ever heard I wanna make impact on the world and 100 of 1,000,000 of dollars. And I'm like, cool, buddy. I wanna pay my mortgage. Meehaw.

[00:13:56] Sue Bryce | So I'm not trying to impact millions of people. I'm trying to impact myself. First, because it's my life, my voice, my business. Then I'm trying to impact my community and the people that are most attracted to me. I'm not starting out here going, I'm gonna impact the world millions of people.

[00:14:18] Sue Bryce | Cool. Impact yourself, man. You know, we're all just trying to survive this. Like, it's not I'm I'm not trying to be world famous. I'm trying to create an income doing what I love doing, helping people in my community doing it.

[00:14:34] Sue Bryce | So multiple revenue streams for me are how you make lots of money, but really the revenue stream I really want you to activate is digital products. Because there's just no reason you should not create digital products and business or for your clients or for other business owners because it's just making money while you sleep. So the next big step was what made something valuable. And as I told you, you just found out the whole value thing that people struggle with so much that I struggled with so much is because in my personal life, I didn't have self value. I was too worried about my body, my weight, my age, my appearance, to put myself out there.

[00:15:20] Sue Bryce | That wasn't self value, so I struggled to find value in my craft. And especially if I have no self value and I make the craft with my own hands, I knit a jersey and I have no self value, then if I put this jersey out there and you say This is a beautiful jersey. I would pay $200 for this, and you made it just for me, and I would feel incredibly validated. But if you said that's a shit jersey, I mean, entry level, not your best work, like, you can't sell it for $200. People over there make way better jerseys for like a $100.

[00:16:05] Sue Bryce | Who do you think you are? Shame, shame, shame, shame. And you can see if you're looking for validation from the people who are looking at your product, you'll never get the truth. You only get what you don't wanna hear. So what's valuable is what's valuable to me because then if you don't value it, I go, oh, not your value, but you can't shame me for valuing something.

[00:16:33] Sue Bryce | Because when you said that my product was shit, you threw shame at me. And because I'm not, because I don't have strong self value, I took that shame and I slapped it on my face, And I decided in that moment I am shit, and I'm not with other what other people charge, and I shouldn't have put that out there because you just told me that. And and it really hurt And it's nothing to do with you, and it's nothing to do with you. It was me. Now if I made that and I valued it and you said it was shit and she paid $200, I'd never see you again.

[00:17:16] Sue Bryce | You're not my client. It's not not important. She just paid $200 and thanked me and then put it on her social media. And because I value it right now in this moment, as a client. I now value her as a client and not you because I have self value.

[00:17:37] Sue Bryce | I'm sorry. I made you do that. I do pick people sometimes, and they're like, oh, no. And I really did a save it. But you know what I mean?

[00:17:47] Sue Bryce | So the value must come from you intrinsically. And the only way you can do intrinsic value is to make something you love, and then other people will be attracted to it because you love it because you find it valuable, not for any other reason. Product focus is really important because this is connection. And when people say what is connection, it's what is valuable to you. So ask these questions, and I want you to do the focus group with your product.

[00:18:13] Sue Bryce | Because these questions are the most important. Is it valuable to you? You're the one making it. You're the one selling it. If you can't tell me the value, you don't value yourself.

[00:18:23] Sue Bryce | It's that simple. Is it desirable? Are people asking for it? When you show something, do people go that's incredible? How do you do that?

[00:18:32] Sue Bryce | How do you get that? Have you written a book? Do you teach that? Do you mentor people are asking you? Is it desirable?

[00:18:41] Sue Bryce | And if they're not asking for it, you're not showing it in a desirable way. You're probably trying to sell it, stop selling it, and just share it. Is it priced with a margin for you? Cause if it's not, it's not sustainable. Is it joyful to create?

[00:18:56] Sue Bryce | Is it joyful to make? Is it joyful to share? And is it joyful to sell? Oh my gosh. I just got goosebumps all over my body when I said, is it joyful to sell?

[00:19:07] Sue Bryce | Because have you ever considered that you would love something so much that you would just not stop selling it. You you just wanna share it. You wanna tell people about it. You don't feel like that about your products right now. Do you?

[00:19:23] Sue Bryce | That's falling in love with your product. Now if you think of that connection, I don't need to sell what I do. I haven't sold a photo shoot for 20 years. I don't need to. I just show people what I do and talk about why I love it and people are in.

[00:19:43] Sue Bryce | That's magic. I love what I create. So it's so easy to share. Alignment. I want you to feel alignment with what we just talked about.

[00:19:58] Sue Bryce | The brands you've created around you. I want you to feel alignment with who you are in that brand, the products you're creating around it, the content you're creating around it. Do you feel alignment? Alignment is when your actions, values, and purpose are all moving in the same direction. It feels good.

[00:20:17] Sue Bryce | It's feeling connected to what you're creating and selling because it's a true expression of who you are. It's about being in harmony with your work, with your energy, and with your vision so that everything you do feels authentic, and empowered, and that's where you're gonna find your value. I want you to print that slide. I want you to put it on the wall in your office, and I want you to say every single day in this business, my job is to come here and get into creative alignment with who I am, what I do, what I've created, and what I offer people, feel that alignment. It's like magic, and it's so crazy because it's so elevating and you can just empower yourself in a room with nobody there, and then you'll touch your computer and there'll be 3 new bookings.

[00:21:04] Sue Bryce | You'll touch your phone and there'll be an opportunity for something you've wanted for months because that creative energy, it's like a vortex of action. Alignment brings action. You don't have to take action. You don't have to force yourself to take action. You have to get into alignment and it forces action.

[00:21:24] Sue Bryce | How can it not? If we called up for lunch and I bought all my drama to you, this woman said this about me, and this guy said this, and I can't do this, and I feel like shit. This is, and they said that you would leave going, well, we trauma bonded over gossip. Right? And that to me is not alignment.

[00:21:45] Sue Bryce | Alignment is when I come into a conversation, and I'm like, how are you doing? I'm great. Business is great. I love doing what I do. I love making what I make.

[00:21:53] Sue Bryce | I love selling what I sell. This is what I'm creating next. This is what I'm currently working on. This is what I'm building. What are you building?

[00:22:00] Sue Bryce | What are you working on? I wanna go to this lunch and have you walk away and go, that's why I like so many time with you. We talk up We talk up, we talk out our creativity, we don't talk about other people, we don't talk about things we don't like. We don't talk about things we don't want because we're just gonna manifest more of them alignment, every single day, alignment with money, alignment with your goals, alignment with your business. Alright.

[00:22:28] Sue Bryce | So I'm taking way too long because I'm at slide number 15, and there's a 111 then. K. And I said I wasn't gonna explain each slide. So I was like, so let me chop through a few of them that you know you know this content. Put one product at a time on the table.

[00:22:46] Sue Bryce | Let's look at it. What is it? Describe it, find the value of it. What is the system and the process of this product or service? And you have to do one at a time.

[00:22:57] Sue Bryce | Okay. Number 1, if you're manufacturing physical products and you're either manufacturing, shipping, or storing. Physical products are in person experience. Digital products are downloadable, and digital services is anything you can do online. All of those things come with an experience.

[00:23:15] Sue Bryce | Okay? And you have to create an experience for every product you have because if your clients are buying in person, the experience will be how they were served. And if they're buying online, it's the customer service, how quickly you can fulfill that order how much follow through you have. And if you cared enough to follow through with somebody that had spent money with you online, is the product gonna get there on time? Are you seeing them?

[00:23:41] Sue Bryce | Because if you go to sleep tonight, and and somebody in Paris has ordered your stuff and it was damaged, destroyed, you didn't care bad customer service, you're gonna wake up to a customer service nightmare. But more importantly, the challenge with this slide is what is the experience that your clients have with you? I want you to ask these questions as you put everything on the table. Is it profitable? Is it sustainable to produce?

[00:24:09] Sue Bryce | Is it priced for the market? Do I feel good about selling it? Do I feel good about marketing it? Period. Now as it comes to marketing this product and sharing it, these are the 3 big questions.

[00:24:21] Sue Bryce | Do you have a following or an audience currently? What do they know about you personally, and what do they know about this product? And I can guarantee if I challenged all of you to send me screenshots of your Instagram, or send me a link to your Instagram, I would challenge how quickly, how many slides or reels or posts I would have to go through before I got information about you, clear information about what you do, what you sell, how you sell it, why you do it, how you do it. And I guarantee 90% of you would fail at that challenge because you are not making it clear what you do, who you are, and what you sell, and what your product is. And I think that that is very, very important.

[00:25:12] Sue Bryce | Okay. This is a big one. Do you have any social proof? I need you to start asking for it. I need you to beta test every single product you have created so that you can get testimonials so that you can get feedback so that you can practice so that you can cut the fluff and so that you can connect the content to real people in real time because they are the best testimonials for you.

[00:25:36] Sue Bryce | I want you to survey your client base and find a way, go back through the survey session, find a way to make it interesting, and make it fun so that you can get all of your questions answered. When it comes to putting you out there, remember this when you're struggling to find your value. I am as a viewer and a client most interested in how you do it, how you use it, why you do it, and why you value it. Those 4 things. It's more important to me that you show me how you do it, how you use it, why you do it, and why it's valuable because I will understand everything from that simple communication, and you're trying not to make it about you.

[00:26:20] Sue Bryce | But you're making it about me, but you're showing what you do for me, because you're making it about me when you show me how you use it, and you're making it about me when you tell me why you do it. And then you're making it about me when you tell me why you value it because you're not trying to sell me something, you are literally telling me the value of it to you and that means something I can feel that that's so important. Money is a value metric. If you're coming into the first two levels of money, which you absolutely know a survival mode and stabilization, you're not going to have a successful business until you get to management. You're just not.

[00:27:03] Sue Bryce | You are operating from guilt and shame because you can't ask for money and you won't receive money, you will go no further. So if you are there right now, you're in complete survival mode with your money, you need to do some work around your guilt and shame, around your self value, and your worth, or you will go no further in this business. These are your money levels, you know this. You've already identified which level you're at. Every single day from now on, you're gonna create a daily ritual to get to the next money level.

[00:27:38] Sue Bryce | So if you're at stabilization, your focus is every day to get to management. You're gonna go and look at what you require to get to a management level and every day refocus the money in a good energy deal with the guilt and shame that comes up. Focus on that money energy and what's your money grow. When you avoid your money, it falls away from you. It goes away, but when you embrace it, it just it just keeps growing, and it keeps growing, and it keeps growing a daily ritual.

[00:28:07] Sue Bryce | I want you to say this out loud whenever you feel bad about money, Money is not emotional. I am. Money is not emotional. I am. However, you do understand that if you put emotion into money, it's gonna be guilt and shame, or it's gonna be love, greed, and neither of those will bring you money.

[00:28:30] Sue Bryce | They will both repel money exponentially from you. So what you need to do is look at money like a byproduct of a joyful life And you've also gotta look at it as the numbers don't lie. The more I focus on them, the more money grows. The best piece of advice I can give you around avoidance is stop avoiding it. You simply fix it.

[00:28:52] Sue Bryce | The second you stop avoiding it, you simply bring your energy to it and you fix it. And a daily ritual means every day I'm fixing my money and every day I'm going to the next level. It's how I got to thrive because you cannot thrive with guilt and shame. And remember guilt and shame specifically are the 2 energies that are pushing money away. You can't ask for more.

[00:29:15] Sue Bryce | You can't ask to be paid. You can't communicate value if you feel guilt and shame. Deal with it. So to me, I look at money as past present future because past is your old programming, present is what you're doing with your money energy right now. All paths of manifestation are about focus and emotion.

[00:29:35] Sue Bryce | So that means I've got to wake up every single day, look at what I'm focusing on and how I feel about it. So if you wake up tomorrow in yesterday's emotions or with yesterday's money pain, what are you going to attract today? More of yesterday's drama and more of yesterday's money pain. Your goal is to get your focus and your emotion, get your focus locked into what you want, and get your emotion clear. Every day, that's it.

[00:30:01] Sue Bryce | I just have to get rid of this past programming that holds on to anything. Someone said something about me. Boohoo. Somebody did this. Somebody trolled me online.

[00:30:12] Sue Bryce | Somebody criticized my work. These things take some processing. But if you're processing this drama in the morning and you're not getting rid of it, you're taking it into your day's work. Why? It wasn't personal.

[00:30:25] Sue Bryce | It was business, and it was an equal exchange of value. And if you drop the ball, you're the one that didn't show up in an equal exchange of value, so you learn the lesson and you fix it for next time. In order for more to come to you, you have to ask for more and then you have to activate the timeline to it. You can't pray for something and then stay sitting on the couch wondering when it's gonna arrive. It doesn't work like that.

[00:30:52] Sue Bryce | A timeline is the next congruent step. How do they get from a survival budget to a Thrive budget? Instead of saying, I don't know how that's going to come to me. Like, I want $10,000 a month, but how? That's not manifestation.

[00:31:11] Sue Bryce | You've said I want $10,000 and then you've said I have no idea how to make $10,000, you're not gonna get it. If you want $10,000 a month and you can see a timeline to it, create the steps to that, and then you'll get there. But don't ask how it's coming to you because if you ask how you're not gonna activate it, it's that simple. There are five ways to make more money right now in your business. And if any of these challenge you today, that is your most urgent need right there.

[00:31:41] Sue Bryce | Because all of these come with a big shift in mindset and self value. So if you can't sell more than what you're already selling, ask yourself why if you can't add more products, why are you holding yourself back? If you can't increase your prices, why can't you say it? Because you can't speak money out. If you wanna lower your costs, but you don't know your cost, you're letting your business run itself and it's out of control and it won't be profitable.

[00:32:07] Sue Bryce | And if you can't add more value because you don't believe you're valuable, you can't take those steps. So right there, those are actionable steps that tell me what's wrong in your business right now. Tell me if you can't do one of those five things. That's what I wanna know. Your future money is how you give it direction and connection.

[00:32:26] Sue Bryce | And the more you look at it and the bigger your goals are and the bigger they're connected to you and the more you create a timeline to it and hold a focus to it, the faster those goals come to you. So to me, every single day, I want a daily ritual with money. I want a daily ritual with resetting my goals and getting back into alignment. I do all of that before I get out of the shower. Business is an equal exchange of value.

[00:32:51] Sue Bryce | Business is not manifestation. You are not manifesting a brand. You are building a business and you are offering a product and service that has an equal exchange or value And once you learn, the more value I feel for myself and my product, the more I can charge for it, and the more I will have an equal exchange of energy with somebody who wants my product, the more you will start to value your product. So when people are like manifesting, manifesting, and and I, like, it's not manifestation to me. It's focused.

[00:33:24] Sue Bryce | You can manifest magical connections. You can manifest more opportunities. You can manifest more clients, you know, being attracted to you. You can manifest the next steps in your timeline, but make no mistake about it. Equal exchange is not manifestation.

[00:33:41] Sue Bryce | Alright? It is not manifesting. It's I know what I'm worth, no more and no less. So no more and no less, the law of no more and no less than what I asked for than what I step up to receive than what I believe I'm worth. If you ask for nothing, you get nothing.

[00:33:58] Sue Bryce | If you ask for enough, you get enough, and if you ask for more, you get more, my friends. And if you're connected to what you're asking for and activating a focus and a timeline to it every day, it's coming to you fast and furious. So many people can't tell me their cost of goods sold, and then you don't know your profit margin. And if you don't know your profit margin, you don't know what you're getting paid this month. Stop acting like you're selling, the total amount work out what your profit margin is.

[00:34:27] Sue Bryce | That is your target, and that's where you have to sell from. If you don't have a profit margin, you won't get paid. Tangible manifestation. It's not wishes and kisses. It's I have a valuable brand.

[00:34:41] Sue Bryce | I have a valuable product and service, and now I can create a goal with this product to service. I created the creative product collect calculator I called it because to me, that's exactly how I would project something. I don't make a product and say, I hope it's good enough. I make a product. I beta test it.

[00:35:02] Sue Bryce | I survey it. I try it. I use it. I fall in love with it. And then I share it.

[00:35:07] Sue Bryce | I share my using it. I don't sell it. It just shared me using it until everyone starts asking for it. Do you have that as a book? Do you have that as a workshop?

[00:35:17] Sue Bryce | Do you do this in person? And I'm like, I shared it, but for me, the goal of what am I pricing in the market? And how many people am I really looking for? Because when I look at this calculator, I spent many years at a $3500 product, okay, because I was a professional photographer that charged 3 and a half $1000. Now to make a $1,000,000 at 3 and a half $1000, I needed to photograph 2 eighty six people at that price point.

[00:35:47] Sue Bryce | So that had to be my complete average. It couldn't be a rolling average, like, you know, 2 to 5000. No. I have a $3,500 average, and I would need 2.86 bums and seats in order to fulfill that. Now when you first start doing that, you think that is, how am I gonna do that?

[00:36:06] Sue Bryce | It doesn't take you long to just start seeing the numbers. Business is a numbers game. And once you position yourself, you also understand there's a glass ceiling there, like, sure, I could photograph two eighty six people for 3 and a half grand and make a $1,000,000, how many staff would I need to do that? How much time would it take to do that? Is it physically possible for me to do that?

[00:36:32] Sue Bryce | With the space that I have and the product I have. So is that even a viable path? The fastest way to think big is to deconstruct what you want. That's how I look at it. If I wanna sell $200 product, and I wanna make a 1,000,000 a $1,000,000 this year, I've gotta find five thousand people that need that $200 product.

[00:36:54] Sue Bryce | And even when I'm conceptualizing the price of it and what even the content is for it, Even in my mind, I'm thinking I want this to sell to five thousand people, so I know that I need to create something that five thousand people need in this space. And it helped me get out of a how mindset and can I mindset into more of a, okay, I never look at things now and say, can I have that? I look at that and say, how did they get that? And how can I take those steps? Towards it.

[00:37:24] Sue Bryce | So I did one for 500,000 because I think it's a really good way for you to project income and also see your glass ceiling and see what you're actually capable of doing. Best piece of advice you got from this workshop is you're not doing it. The best piece of advice I ever got was the moment I realized I was not doing the thing that I felt stuck, not doing. And the doing of it is where the action is formed, and that is so important. Remember this, so many times we get tripped off our own path with self sabotage, doing avoidance behaviors to avoid something in us.

[00:38:01] Sue Bryce | I want you to make the connection to living unfulfilled and always looking fulfilling. Nothing extrindic can fulfill your soul. Nothing you can put in your body will fulfill your soul. It will only fill your belly, and it will fill your mind for a short period of time, and it will distract you, but the things

[00:38:26] Sue Bryce | that fill our soul are not things that alleviate stress. That's just avoidance. And if you get stuck in avoidance, ask yourself

[00:38:39] Sue Bryce | Why am I looking for false fulfillment when I can fulfill myself by walking the path that I truly want? Putting yourself out there is a big one. You'll get over it. Marketing is clarity. Best piece of advice, and I just told Natalie this, she said I filmed myself, on in a video for a reel, and I watched it, and I was like, what?

[00:39:03] Sue Bryce | And I did it again, and I was like, what? And then I watched it again, and I was like, what? And I said, here's the secret. When you watch yourself on video, if you can't watch it yourself, it's not authentic. You're not in your authentic voice.

[00:39:17] Sue Bryce | And the difference is simple. Putting yourself out there is simple. When I'm authentic, I'm not thinking about what I look like. I'm not trying to, like, you know, how some people do reels and they pose? They stand in a pose, and they're like, hi, everybody.

[00:39:31] Sue Bryce | I'm just in, like, I'm just in this pose. I'm like, no. And what it is for me is when I'm recording my self, if I'm looking at my reflection and worrying about how I look, I'm not being authentic. And when it comes to watching it, when it's authentic, you can watch it. It's really weird.

[00:39:47] Sue Bryce | And then you start to do this thing where you're like, oh, my mouth makes a weird shape. And I look kinda old or whatever. And then you go, but I'm kinda quite likable. And I'm funny, and it's like, oh, she's kinda cool. I started to actually like myself.

[00:40:02] Sue Bryce | And that's when I knew I was speaking the most authentically. So the best way to get over that is, I don't know, think of something you really love, like your kids or your dog or whatever, and film yourself talking about something you really love for 2 minutes. Like, really love. Don't look at the camera. Just talk and really like, I love that about them, and you're the only one that's gonna watch it.

[00:40:24] Sue Bryce | And then look back, and when you feel the authenticity in your voice, you will be able to like it and weirdly, you'll start to feel really attracted to yourself. Like, you'll be like, I kinda like this person, and it's when it's really authentic. Okay. So marketing is clarity. If you can't describe it simply, you don't know it well enough.

[00:40:45] Sue Bryce | Einstein said it, it's the truth. And what it really comes down to is do people know who you are and what you do and who you do it for? And you think you're telling people, but you're not. And you think you're describing it really easy, but you're not. So lots more communication and lots more simple communication.

[00:41:05] Sue Bryce | Is it clear who you are, what you do, is it clear what products you sell, how long would it take me on your social media to actually work that out myself just from your 3 by 3 and your profile. So if you have a money problem, then you have a self value problem. If you have a marketing problem, you have a clarity problem and probably a value problem as well. So just go back to the value work. If it's not selling, it's not connected.

[00:41:34] Sue Bryce | I don't care what anybody says. When I'm connected to a product, it sells. When I'm not connected to it, it does not. What is your brand mission? What is your invitation?

[00:41:45] Sue Bryce | What is your promise to your clients? Those are three things I wanna know and there are three things you should be able to answer because, a promise for me is what do you promise those people? You spend money with me, and I promise you. Like, that comes loaded. That's not just that this is what you're getting for your money.

[00:42:05] Sue Bryce | What is your promise and your invitation? How do you invite people to your business? You know, as a photographer, I would always say when was the last time you were photographed professionally? Because straight away, I would get people go, oh, well, my wedding, like, 23 years ago, And inevitably, I would say my invitation to me was I want to photograph you because I want to take the best photograph you have ever seen of yourself. Like, I believe it.

[00:42:42] Sue Bryce | I feel it. And all my goossees, that's my promise. That's my invitation. And I was like, people just knew that I was telling the truth because I am. Find what your truth is when you say it.

[00:42:55] Sue Bryce | Create a hot seat. Did everyone want to do that, or would anyone wanna scared of that, or would anyone like more of that? Like, let's work around more of doing that because I would love to see people in the hot seat, and I would love people around you telling you about your brand and about you so that you can really push into that. The reason you do it is what question do you really need clarity around? And I think that that's very, very important.

[00:43:21] Sue Bryce | You need to understand how other people see you, so work out what it is that you need to know from these people and ask them that. Remember, reward this group or return the service. So either create a network where people are also able to experience this with you but when you create a focus group with you in the hot seat, everybody is there to make your brand better. Everyone is there to make you better, and I have to challenge you just in one question when I said this during that session, who do you go to for help? Do you go to when you need inspiration?

[00:43:55] Sue Bryce | Who do you go to when you can't work something out in your business? Who do you go to when you need the truth? Who do you go to when you need somebody sitting back at you, showing you who you are, who do you trust enough to say, this this is my vision for myself because as soon as you put your vision in front of other people, you'll get division because they will put their 10¢ and they will divide your vision. And right then, who do you go to? Because all I learned was when I built my business, I felt the most isolated I have ever felt in my life.

[00:44:29] Sue Bryce | I felt like I didn't have peers that I could talk to. I felt like if I did, they judged the money I was making or how I was doing things, I felt like people outside of my industry gave me stupid advice, and I'd be like, that doesn't apply to me. That's not even my industry. So I felt really alone, and I felt like there wasn't anywhere I could go. And when I could go there, there were dreams that I had that I didn't wanna share because you're also building the same business.

[00:44:55] Sue Bryce | And if you hear my big vision and you get weird about it, then we can't be friends anymore. See? It was like, it's one of those things. It's like, but to be able to sit in the hot seat of people dedicated to just bring you this information about you and your business, that's what you're doing it for. In your marketing, I pushed very hard to stop selling.

[00:45:18] Sue Bryce | No more selling in your marketing, we show don't tell I've put these slides in because these slides are important. If you're struggling with your marketing text, you need to understand that you're gonna sell everything but the products so you need to tell me what your value is. I've put these in there because these are big ones. Show the benefits show how it's used, show the joy of wanting it, getting it, enjoying it, using it, show the experience, the gift, the reaction, the transformation, show the connection, show the creativity, show the empowerment, show the fun, show the education, show the founder story, show your story, Show the product story, the brand story, show all of your client stories, show the making of it, show the creation process, show the crafting of it, the mastery, show the manufacturing, show the how, and show the why. And then invite everybody on your social media to come to your community and join your community.

[00:46:11] Sue Bryce | These are the people you're selling to. You are not selling on social media. You are entertaining, engaging, inspiring, empowering, you are just engaging people there. But every time you say join my VIP list, join my network, join my community, join my members only group, join my newsletter, join the revolution. You bring those people, the people that you can sell to to a private space.

[00:46:38] Sue Bryce | And that's why I don't sell on Instagram. I sell privately in a community or in an email group. So build that list Now reward that list because this is the biggest problem. We finally build a social media, and then we've gotta build that list, and we finally build the list, but we spend all of our energy making social media posts for the people that don't buy. And you're not rewarding that 10% or that 5% that said, I'll give you my email.

[00:47:10] Sue Bryce | I wanna know more. So what are we doing that for? You know, you're spending all this energy trying to be good enough for a group of strangers that are not on your list that don't wanna buy from you that just and they might be people in your industry just following you to get tips or just to check out why they don't like you or compete with you in their own head every single day. And all those people, and yet the most valuable people are the people that you can reward that you're inviting to your private list. So find a way to communicate with those people that get more than the people on your social media do.

[00:47:49] Sue Bryce | Otherwise, you will keep growing your social. You won't grow a community. You won't sell to anybody. You'll live 500,000 followers and no money. And that's not how you make money.

[00:48:01] Sue Bryce | You don't you don't make money just because they follow you. That's not how it works. In fact, it's absolutely not how it works. If you could create a lead generator video for your business for your clients, or for your peers, what would it be and what's stopping you from doing it right now? Whatever you sell, whether it's coaching, a product, or a service, the second that it's sold out, open a wait list.

[00:48:31] Sue Bryce | Okay? And then instead of selling on social media, you go to social media and you say this is already sold out. So people are like, I didn't even get a chance to buy it. They will be indignant. But if you post 8 selling posts, like, buy this workshop, buy this workshop, buy this workshop, they're all like, oh, stinky.

[00:48:54] Sue Bryce | The second you go on there and say, my workshop's sold out. Next one is in 8 weeks, but you you need to get on my waiting list because these are going fast. As soon as you're fully booked, sell it out, and create demand around you. Okay. Ask yourself, who do I want following me?

[00:49:13] Sue Bryce | I used photographers as an example because I used to post for my clients. And as I became an educator, I stopped posting to my clients and I started posting more to photographers. However, What you don't realize is all I ever did was post 2 photographers about my clients, which ironically also got me more clients, but you have to really work out who the audience is. Now if you wanna sell stuff in a community, you could bring the peers to a community and keep your social media as you're following. That's a good one, and that works.

[00:49:49] Sue Bryce | But who are you talking to because that's what you need to focus on. Who is the following that I'm building right now? I want you to work on join the community, the wait list, or the newsletter, subscribe, newsletter, YouTube channel membership, follow Instagram Pinterest TikTok with Facebook, whatever your social media is. An audience is a product because people can pay you as an ambassador or an influencer or a product ambassador and the more audience you have, the more they will pay you. For appearances, the more they'll pay you for products, the more you'll get sponsorship for products, but an audience is not a community.

[00:50:29] Sue Bryce | Don't mix up the 2. A community is what you invite them to as you're in a circle. An audience is a social following. They want engagement and entertainment. A community wants connection and 1 on 1 engagement, and they will buy from you.

[00:50:44] Sue Bryce | Find out how you wanna do this, know to Facebook groups. If you want to learn how to sell, change the way you feel about yourself and your product. If you struggle to sell there is something about you and your product that you're holding back, and that is a value problem. I want you to elevate your energy every single time you come to this business. And I don't just mean when you walk into it, Elevate your energy when you go on social media.

[00:51:16] Sue Bryce | Elevate your energy first. Speak from a place of respect and speak from a place of giving and speak from a place of expertise and watch people treat you like that. Bring your full self to everything you do in the business. It's palpable. You can feel it.

[00:51:33] Sue Bryce | And that's why when people are not authentic with what they're saying, you can feel it, but you don't know what it is. You just know something's off, and it's so palpable and yet it's online and you're like, oh, why? Like, why am I feeling this way? But what you're what you're really, really noticing is it's just not authentic. It's not authentic to the person who's speaking.

[00:51:56] Sue Bryce | I'm a big goal setter because I wanna take action, but then I spend a lot of time in alignment, so taking action is my next step because if you're in alignment and you're talking about something, it's inevitable it's gonna come to fruition. So every single day, I connect to my goals. I know what I want as a big goal. I also know that I create the vision for it. I know what I want.

[00:52:19] Sue Bryce | I create the vision for it. I speak it out. Okay. I love it, and then I take action doing it. I know the path that I have to take in order to make something happen, but that for me, every single day is I just wanna reconnect to the goals.

[00:52:37] Sue Bryce | You don't realize in business how often And I know this because when I said it out loud the first time, I can't remember where it was. It must have been around segment 5 or 6. I watched everyone in the room energy shift, and I saw the chat roll really, really fast. And I said, start doing what you say you're gonna do because we talk a lot. Right?

[00:53:01] Sue Bryce | We talk a lot about what we don't want. We talk a lot about the next steps. We talk a lot about can I? We hear ourselves say it. But when you say you're gonna do something, do it.

[00:53:12] Sue Bryce | Do it. If you're scared to go networking, but you gotta do it. Like, you face it, man. Watch yourself. I found a resilience in myself.

[00:53:24] Sue Bryce | I didn't know I was capable of when I told myself that day, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do what I say I'm gonna do. And I was crying and remember I was railing at the universe and then the canon was calling, but I couldn't hear because I was screaming. And that's what I was saying. You're not doing You're not doing it.

[00:53:49] Sue Bryce | You say you're doing it. You're thinking about it, but you're actually not doing it. You're too scared. You're living scared. Stop living scared.

[00:53:57] Sue Bryce | I'm gonna start doing it. You need to have a difficult conversation with someone. Do it. It'll all be gone. The difficulty is all gone.

[00:54:07] Sue Bryce | The feeling is all gone. You know, if you need to set a boundary with someone, do it. If you need to take that next step in your business, do it. Just do it, do what you say you're gonna do, and I tell you why it's you when you how many times if you had a lover that told you every day they were gonna do something and they didn't do it, how much respect would you lose for them? If every day, they looked at you and said, I'm gonna do this thing, and then they didn't do it.

[00:54:36] Sue Bryce | How many years would you listen to that before you heard somebody go, I'm gonna do it. And you go, but you don't. You're not. You're not doing it. How much respect would you lose if somebody said, I'm gonna do that tomorrow, and you go, okay, and you turn up tomorrow, and they haven't done it.

[00:55:03] Sue Bryce | And you go, you you said you were gonna do that thing for me. And you were like, well, I couldn't because I didn't think I could or wanted to. And you're like, okay. This is what we do to ourselves. And you think it's that you're sitting back doing it, but you're actually not doing it.

[00:55:20] Sue Bryce | And when I think in those darkest moments of the I'm gonna do it. That's what I was saying. I was actually saying I'm gonna overcome my fear, and I'm gonna do what I say I'm gonna do. And then I started, would you believe it, to do what I said I was gonna do? And I ended up here in a year.

[00:55:36] Sue Bryce | So that tells me that I simply was not doing it. Time is the most valuable commodity you have. Once you work that out, you will be very, very,

[00:55:46] Sue Bryce | very, very, very careful about who you

[00:55:46] Sue Bryce | spend your time within how you spend it. It's finite Once it's gone, you don't get it back. You're trading money for time, and the time you're trading is with your family. So if you can't see yourself as valuable, start seeing your time is valuable and what that change your value. Every day, I want you to have a personal priority, right?

[00:56:12] Sue Bryce | Every day you're gonna prioritize, and they say choose 3. So you can create work, you can move your body, you can do friends and social, you can do play hobbies, spouse family, self care, or rest. But every single day, your daily ritual needs to start. I'm a business owner, and I'm a parent. I need to get my family up, happy, and healthy, and out the store.

[00:56:35] Sue Bryce | I need to get myself up happy, healthy, and out this door and bring my full energy to this business so that I can serve and receive an equal exchange. So having a daily ritual is so important. Every single day before I come to the table, I connect to what I create. I can tell you because, look, my truth is already here. I connect to what I create.

[00:57:00] Sue Bryce | Oh, I connect to the people I create with. I connect to the people I create for, and I connect to

[00:57:10] Sue Bryce | why I create. I feel those 4 things in

[00:57:20] Sue Bryce | every cell of my body. This is magic. I love who I am, and I love what I make, and I love what I've created, and I love what I get to share with my clients and the people in this room and the people out there right now. And every single day, I do that. I connect to what I create.

[00:57:42] Sue Bryce | I connect to the people I create with. I connect to the people I create for. I connect to why I create and then I sit there and just gratitude that I am a creator and I make my own money, and I am fully independent, and I get to create every day and what an incredible gift that I have, built. Not been given. What an incredible gift that I have built.

[00:58:20] Sue Bryce | I built the business for me. So let's set your business goals. And every day, you reconnect to those goals, and those goals have to be the path forward and they have to be the true path. And they have to every single day. Now I know you're working on one of these 6 things.

[00:58:38] Sue Bryce | I know you are because in a personal brand, you're either working on the identity of the brand, you're either working on the product still because you don't think it's valuable yet. You're working on the systems around you that bring you momentum and money. You're working on your marketing content. You're working on your networking content in person, or you're working on just that connection and clarity in your business and your brand. But really, I asked you guys if there were more and those six things seemed to be really good focus points.

[00:59:07] Sue Bryce | So if you don't know what to work on tomorrow, look at that list and ask yourself, where do I really need to turn my attention? Is there one of those lines I'm avoiding? Like, let's say you're avoiding your marketing content or building that sales system or building that money system that's gonna get you more money, I need you to stop avoiding choose one of these areas and focus on it every day create a goal on every single line. These are outstanding action points, and all of them will contribute to your business. Every single day, if you didn't even know what to do, I would wake up and go, okay.

[00:59:44] Sue Bryce | I'm gonna look at my taking care of business list. And on my taking care of business list, let's have a look. Alright. I need to do some work around my product. I know I have not created an experience for my clients.

[00:59:55] Sue Bryce | I know that one of my products needs to be pulled. It needs to be redesigned. It needs to be reconnected to because sometimes I create things, and then I lose a love for them, and I have to go and redo them again to find the love that I have for them. And then I'm like, wait, this is really good stuff, and I like this. Now I'm reconnected to that product again.

[01:00:15] Sue Bryce | I mean, it's crazy, but it is true. I want you to focus on everything you do in your personal brand is to elevate you in the personal brand to get a position that elevates you in this personal brand. You're not there to elevate others. You're not there to build an entourage. You're not there to make your makeup artist or your designer or your bookkeeper more successful than you, which is what you're all trying to do, you're not there to elevate other people.

[01:00:42] Sue Bryce | You are there to position and elevate yourself as a business owner and a service provider. I'm excited to see all of your new about pages. And when they are done, I've already seen a couple put them in the group. I wanna see them even if it's just better photo, better video, and a better description of who you are, we've gotta start putting you into the brand. So I said make it part sales page, make it part, you know, about page, you know, tell your business story, tell your brand story, put a narrative in there.

[01:01:11] Sue Bryce | You know, it's like an infographic or a resume and and anything on that page because that page is about you, and I really want you to put yourself out there. I want you to present your business networking. It is the fastest way to get a following. It's the fastest way to sell. It is the fastest way to make amazing connections to build a community is to stand up at a networking and talk about your business for 5 to 10 minutes.

[01:01:39] Sue Bryce | Because if you can't do that, that would be your next big challenge. And if you can't stand up and talk about your business for 5 minutes to a roomful of business owners, you're not ready to sell. You're not ready to put it out there. There's still too much am I good enough, too much me involved, too much shame, too much am I? Can I say that instead of giving proudly from a place of confidence knowing full well what you offer in your brand and your product?

[01:02:10] Sue Bryce | Survey your clients so that you can know about what you do right, what you do wrong, you can get data from them. You can get testimonials from them, but the reason that we do the survey is to understand how they experienced you and your product and your service and understand how your clients see you because you're going to be blown away when your clients, when they like you, they will tell you things about you that you're like, wow, I didn't know that. And then once you start hearing it, you're getting all this incredible feedback you'll start to know how they feel about you, and I think that that's really important for your focus group, create an evening, create a group, create a show, create a network. This would be a YouTube channel. This would be a show I could see hot seats running and people just as long as the person in the hot seat has 3 to 5 people that are contributing to their brand, I think it would be incredible to watch.

[01:03:09] Sue Bryce | And I'd like to watch multiple hot seats and see where incredible people can give ideas to people, like, that just the idea of starting that is incredible. Don't be afraid of it. Where do you need clarity? That's what you're gonna ask. Okay.

[01:03:25] Sue Bryce | That's the most important part. Don't just do it for them to blow smoke. You're not there to blow smoke. Although maybe sometimes you are, maybe that's what you need. Maybe part of the group could be Okay, guys.

[01:03:42] Sue Bryce | In this part of the segment, this is about totally blowing smoke. I just want you superficially to give me, you know, some heads up on, like, how you think other people see me from the outside in, like, what it is, but then also speak to that authentic part of me, like whatever you need to know. I always say the fastest way for you to understand what your business needs right now is to answer this question like you are telling me. Okay? So if I subrise right now, I'm looking at each of you individually, if I subrise could solve a problem for you and your business right now, what would that be?

[01:04:27] Sue Bryce | If you were to come sit in front of me, I go. Hey.

[01:04:33] Sue Bryce | Go.

[01:04:35] Sue Bryce | And you could tell me your problem, and I could solve it. What is that problem? That's what you need to know. If I, surprise, could solve one big problem with you selling, what would that be? If I could solve one big problem with your marketing, What would that be?

[01:05:00] Sue Bryce | And if I could solve one big problem for you personally, what could that be? And when you tell me what you need to solve in all four of those areas, your business will move forward. But you have to identify the problem. Because what makes you think I could solve it? Until you identify the problem, no one can solve it, especially you.

[01:05:35] Sue Bryce | So we start this way. We start with the Sue's gonna solve this problem for me, and you know it's not. It's there so that you can work out what the problem is. Nobody can fix it until you decide. But if there's a problem to solve for you personally, Find out what it is.

[01:05:51] Sue Bryce | And if there's a little problem you need to solve with your marketing, with your selling, with your business, find out what it is, and the easiest way to do that is imagine you're coming to tell me what the problem is. That's what you need to work on. Those 4 things are stopping you from moving forward, what you believe they are. Shift your focus out of, retail mindset. Retailers put a 100% markup on their clothes.

[01:06:19] Sue Bryce | So when they sell something for 70% off, it's still wholesale plus profit. They only take it to 70% off. There's no 80% 90% off, 99% off, there's only 80% off, or 70 to 80% off because that's literally all of the margin they were gonna make. But selling that product for $30, even though the margin, the Martin $30 selling it for 300, they still get paid. The wholesaler still gets paid.

[01:06:45] Sue Bryce | The retail store still gets paid. Crazy, isn't it? But we don't think of money like this. So if I have a $300 product and my Thrive now is $6000 in my head, I'm just like, I need to sell 20 of those, and I'll hit my Thrive. No.

[01:07:05] Sue Bryce | No. No. No. My margin from the 300 is a $100, so I would need to sell 6 day of those to hit my $6000. And the best part is is I would

[01:07:13] Sue Bryce | receive $18,000,

[01:07:13] Sue Bryce | and I would think that

[01:07:13] Sue Bryce | was all

[01:07:13] Sue Bryce | my money. This is so basic but this is the mentality that stops businesses from moving forward. And and it's funny when you say really basic stuff like this because people are like, well, duh, and yet you're thinking, oh, I calculate from my whole my retail, not my wholesale, I

[01:07:38] Sue Bryce | calculate from, my total gross income, not from my targeted budget

[01:07:38] Sue Bryce | that I've set aside for me and not from my

[01:07:41] Sue Bryce | margin.

[01:07:51] Sue Bryce | And that's how you need to start thinking like a business owner. Now if you're gonna sell your business, what they're gonna do is they're gonna look at how much do you sell this product for? And you're at $300 and they go, cool. How much does it cost to make it? 200, because my margin is only 100.

[01:08:08] Sue Bryce | Right? How many units do you sell per year? And then you tell them that's how people buy a business. Nothing else. So units in, units out, how much does it cost to make it, manufacture it, deliver it?

[01:08:24] Sue Bryce | Is there a profit margin? Is there a goodwill in this business? And that's a 6 time EBITDA on your profit margin? K. Incredible.

[01:08:32] Sue Bryce | So if we worked our businesses like this and we didn't take cash and we worked from our margin and sold from our margin, that's when we start making successful businesses on paper that can be sold. And yet most solar printers are operating with cash and not putting it all through their business, and they're operating from a total gross sales instead of from their margin. Change it. Get into a business mindset. That takes a bit of time.

[01:08:59] Sue Bryce | Remember this, how

[01:09:00] Sue Bryce | you think on the inside is your interior life and you attract

[01:09:00] Sue Bryce | from that place, how you feel, how you feel responds to how you think. It's that simple. All you have to do is master how you think and start changing your thoughts so that your reactions are always there. I have a big thing to say about discipline. If you have to discipline yourself, you don't want to do it.

[01:09:28] Sue Bryce | I don't believe you have to discipline yourself to do something you love. You don't. You joyfully show up. And if you have to make yourself do it, you don't want to do it. Now there's things we make ourselves do but don't discipline yourself in business.

[01:09:42] Sue Bryce | That's not how it works. This is where you need to discipline yourself. Spend some time reading through this list because when I really sat down and said, what is discipline? Discipline isn't making you do something. Discipline isn't that horrible thing like you're a failure, you have no discipline.

[01:09:59] Sue Bryce | It's about showing up the way you want to show up and connected to it every step of the way. So discipline yourself to set boundaries to make creative time for you, discipline yourself to put yourself first,

[01:10:13] Sue Bryce | and keep putting yourself first so that you can serve others around you. Remember that the most

[01:10:13] Sue Bryce | authentic you will ever feel is your truth And when you film yourself and you struggle to watch it, it's because it's not authentic to you. Keep talking until you find your authenticity. It's off the charts. It rates higher than happiness, joy, It erates higher than rage as an energy, love, authenticity. Authenticity is the truth.

[01:10:38] Sue Bryce | My truth. Now if my truth rings true for you, you identify my authenticity easy because you have the same feeling, but it's my truth. It's what what makes what I want. It's about what I want to create and who I am and what I feel inside and being brave enough to show people that because you it's so amazing. I thought I was, like, not polished when I first started speaking, and and and I'm still not.

[01:11:24] Sue Bryce | But I was like, if you're authentic and people connect with your authentic, that's an authenticity.

[01:11:29] Sue Bryce | They won't

[01:11:29] Sue Bryce | worry about stuff like that. Don't worry about if you said something wrong or think that because they just get the real the realness of you. So just don't be afraid to be the most authentic self in your business because you truly will just attract people that just love authentic energy and you start attracting really authentic people. And it

[01:11:47] Sue Bryce | doesn't matter if you think you look old or whatever. It's like the most

[01:11:48] Sue Bryce | authentic you will attract all those people around you, and it really truly. I say palpable because it truly is. Make the

[01:12:02] Sue Bryce | business for you. What have you got to lose?

[01:12:02] Sue Bryce | If it's not making money, why wouldn't you change if Like, if what you've been doing is not working, get a clue. Why would you create a business that you don't want? I want to create a business that I want to go to that I want to talk about, making things that I wanna make with the people I wanna make them with. That's what I want. So I remembered thinking when I was creating my business, I was searching for identity, And everything that I was being shown back to me was you can't do that and you can't do that and you can't do that because those are other people's limits.

[01:12:45] Sue Bryce | And I get that, but there was something inside me. There were 2 things. One was defiance Like, don't tell me what I can and can't do. Start there. If I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna prove it to you.

[01:13:01] Sue Bryce | So, like, you know, I was like, don't tell me I can't do something. And then all of a sudden, I keep thinking, I know that you're saying that won't work, and I agree with you, but I don't wanna do it that way. That's what I keep thinking. I know that you said I can't do it this way, but I think of your way, and I don't wanna do it your way. I wanna do it my way, and I wanna try.

[01:13:24] Sue Bryce | And at the bottom line for me was I'm not making money. So what's the worst thing that can happen? I will continue to not make money and guess what? I made $500,000 that year. In gross income.

[01:13:37] Sue Bryce | And I was

[01:13:37] Sue Bryce | like, and you all

[01:13:37] Sue Bryce | told me I couldn't do this. And you all told me I could not do this. That's when I set my mom down at the end of my 1st year, and I was like, mom, I borrowed $3000 off you to start my business. I paid that

[01:13:56] Sue Bryce | back tenfold, and that's when I set

[01:13:57] Sue Bryce | it down and said, mom, we need to talk, and she was like, what? And I was like, we we made $500,000 for my garage this year, and my mom was like, and I said, you, you, You told me I could do anything. You said the world is your oyster, and you said I could be anything I wanted to be, but you never told me about business. You never taught me about business. And that's when mom told me this story about my dad, not, you know, that their business failed when they were 23 years old, and I was like, I didn't even know this.

[01:14:34] Sue Bryce | And here I was telling this to my mom, and I I felt like somebody had given me the keys to the kingdom. And I just whipped it out. And I was like, nothing's gonna stop me now. Nothing is gonna stop me now. That was way before my rock bottom here, so, you know, it does stop you.

[01:14:56] Sue Bryce | The biggest lesson that you can learn in business is this is about giving. It's not about you, it's about giving. And they must be in balance and it must be an equal exchange. And Wallace Swaddlers in his book, the science of getting rich He says, do you wanna grab that? The science of getting rich, one of the things he says in that book is, give more than what you receive.

[01:15:21] Sue Bryce | He says, give more an every sense of the word than what you receive. Because when you give more than you receive, but you're in balance of receiving. So you're not just like going, no, no, you're actually receiving as well. You will always feel like you're a good person and that you're giving from that place of, like, abundance, which I love. Remember to always ask this in the multiverse every day?

[01:15:46] Sue Bryce | What do I want? And can I see it clearly? Because if I can't see it clearly, I cannot bring it to fruition. Can I speak it up and out? Can I speak about it with love?

[01:15:59] Sue Bryce | Am I doing it, or am I just talking about it? And when I think about doing it, how do I feel about it? And am I open to asking for and receiving this? Because you can't yearn for something. If you want something, wake up and activate the path to it and do it with that.

[01:16:21] Sue Bryce | So remember, the vision is clarity and heart connection. The action is doing it, and that's the magic because that's where the identity is formed. It's formed in the action, not in the vision. So you can sit at home and say, I want this for myself. I want this for myself.

[01:16:36] Sue Bryce | I want this for myself, but if you don't speak it out to anybody because, you know, people have poo pooed your dreams before, if you don't speak it out, you can't activate it. And if you don't, then fall in love with it, you can't do those steps. So get it out. Be specific. I want financial freedom.

[01:16:50] Sue Bryce | I want to be rich. I want to be pain free. That's great, but be specific. Write down what you want and truly want and be very clear about it. Okay?

[01:17:11] Sue Bryce | And do not ask for love. Do not ask for respect or do not ask for something that's external to you because that is not what you need. If you're asking for love, love yourself. If you're asking for respect, respect yourself. But if you feel like people don't love and respect you, it's because you don't love and respect yourself.

[01:17:30] Sue Bryce | Go and do that work. I want you to work on all four areas. So a business owner is a position of respect and authority. You're going into networking groups, you're somebody, you're a podcaster, a broadcaster, an educator, a designer, you're a creator, you're a business owner, stand proud, elevate yourself, and imagine that every single thing you do with every client in your business is about emotional intelligence. Okay?

[01:18:01] Sue Bryce | Self awareness around me, social awareness, around my people, self management, around around myself, managing myself and my emotions and my focus and my goals and my money and my business and my staff and my talent and then relationship management, building relationships and networking, building relationships with clients, there is a lot of growth in this area, and it all comes down to EQ, so nurture that, like push into it. What's your love language? Is that in your service? Is your love language in your words of marketing? What is the part of this that you can incorporate what you love the most and what your love language is into this business?

[01:18:43] Sue Bryce | What's your daily ritual for money? What's your daily ritual for goal setting and have you nailed your VIP time yet? Because until you start creating VIP time in your business for you to grow yourself, your money, and your business, you will not get this time. Nobody. Nobody will care about your time in solitude.

[01:19:04] Sue Bryce | It has no value to anybody but you. Alright? So if you give yourself away, it's gone. If you find yourself people pleasing, get a life by design. People pleasing just means I don't have my own needs.

[01:19:22] Sue Bryce | And so I just fall into other people's needs. So if you find yourself people pleasing and you realize I'm not fulfilled, I'm not connected. I'm not connected to goals. I'm not in love with my products. I don't back myself.

[01:19:37] Sue Bryce | I don't sell myself. I'm not there yet. Get a life by design. Stop people pleasing your life away. People pleases are resentful people.

[01:19:52] Sue Bryce | I know because I was one and my gallbladder collapsed, and that's pure resentment and bitterness. And I was so resentful that everybody else was getting their need met and my needs were never met. And, you know, I flipped people pleasing now. I used to think people pleasing were good people. I was a good person.

[01:20:13] Sue Bryce | I thought I was a good person that just put myself second So the other people more deserving could go in front of me. And the thing is with being a people pleaser is I didn't like who I was or what I said yes to or what I did. And then I just realized people pleases hate being disliked. It is the worst thing for them to set a boundary and have someone get angry at them for their own boundary. So one day I just sat down and I was like, I'm not gonna be a people pleasing anymore.

[01:20:48] Sue Bryce | It's okay if you don't like me. Yeah. It's okay. You might not know why I did something, but that's okay. I'm gonna live with it.

[01:20:58] Sue Bryce | So stop worrying about what everybody thinks about you. Most people don't care. They don't talk about you when you're not in the room, unless it elevates them in some way, or, well, yeah, because even when people talk about your negative plans to elevate themselves, so people don't care what you're doing, so just go and do it. And if you upset somebody by your actions, like if I did something that hurt you, I would apologize for that. But if I did something successful and that made you resent Paul and angry, that's not my problem.

[01:21:33] Sue Bryce | You're a stuck girlfriend. If you would like the way out, come and talk to me, and I'll tell you the way out. Again, I picked you. She'll just run it then. I always say focus on what you really want in life, right, the people you wanna live with,

[01:21:51] Sue Bryce | the

[01:21:51] Sue Bryce | things you wanna master, what you want to find joyful, the relationships you wanna have, the house you wanna live in, the healthy body you want to enjoy. Like, that's what you should be waking up to every single day and just walking towards that because that's like building a life by design of who you are and what you honor in yourself. A daily ritual of money growth will just bring you back to growing money. And also do this. This is a really good one because you had to pick which level you're at with money so whichever level you're at.

[01:22:23] Sue Bryce | And also, when I asked you to do this, I asked you not to describe your home income. I asked you to describe your business income, and most of you put your businesses back in survival. A lot of you were in management or sustainability with your family life, but when I asked you to do the money around your business, a lot of you went back to survival in your business, which told me your business is living month to month. And I want your business to have a security fund So you start at the top and you work your way down until you feel uncomfortable, and then you work on that line and the next line until you get to the next level of money. Reconnect your heart.

[01:23:06] Sue Bryce | Reconnect to to how and why you do business. It doesn't take even if I get sick of myself, sick of my business, sick of my whatever, sick of my routine, it doesn't take me long to sit down and start thinking about, going to work for somebody else. Like, I think I'm unemployable for starters but the idea that I would go and get a job is enough for me to be like snap out of anything. Like, I can find that real fast because I don't ever want to be back in that position again. Sometimes I get out of balance with my clients because I'm an overgiver, and then I feel like they're sucking my will to live.

[01:23:54] Sue Bryce | I have to take a break, reset my boundaries, and reconnect back to what I do, how I do it, why I do it, so that I can show up in my fullest version of myself. I want you to realize now as you're making your timelines towards what you want in every area of your business that the timeline is not about time. This is not in 2 years. I will have this thing. I told you it wasn't about time.

[01:24:22] Sue Bryce | That's why time is such such a hard thing to teach because time unfolds. It's it's not linear. It's not the next step and the next step, but your steps unfold time. Do you understand? You want something over there and you can see the 10 steps that you need to get there, that's a timeline.

[01:24:47] Sue Bryce | How fast that's gonna come to you is based on how connected you are to every one of those steps. So it's not based on time. It's based on steps. Don't take action. Get into alignment.

[01:25:00] Sue Bryce | Alignment forces action. Okay. For your future money, I need you to have money security in your business, start with 500, then a 1000, then 10,000, then $20,000, then a 100,000. Once you get to there, every single time the economy turns, a client cancels, you have a bad month, you break your ankle. Every time the money is just there.

[01:25:29] Sue Bryce | It's there to protect you, and it gives you a feeling of security and safety that is unparalleled every day in your daily ritual, I want you to take 5 minutes for well, you take a minute, abundance. However, you express your gratitude. I want you to focus on it, connect to it, create with it, create a timeline to it. I want you to hit your gratitude every day. And remember this one thing because I think it's so important gratitude is that something I'm receiving something I've asked for.

[01:26:03] Sue Bryce | So spend as much time asking for new things and gratitude for receiving what you've asked for because then you're gonna feel really good about this on a system. Every day I want you to reconnect to your alignment. Stay out of your mind loop, out of your comparison, out of the competition, refocus on what you want every day, replenish all those goals, process your emotions around it because focus and emotion is how you manifest. Right? And if you get stuck in your alignment, read yourself this.

[01:26:34] Sue Bryce | What do you want? Why do you want it? What is your intention here? What is the prayer or declaration around this? What is your vision?

[01:26:48] Sue Bryce | Do you have clarity? Is this spoken with truth? Do you feel authentic? What is your connection or your heart activation to this path you're about to walk and what is the action and the next congruence step that I need to take on my timeline to get what I want. You attract from how you feel, not what you think, How you feel is a reaction to how you think.

[01:27:21] Sue Bryce | Feelings are not emotions. You don't conquer your emotions. You conquer your thoughts, and that shifts your emotions. That slide is manifestation in a nutshell. You attract from how you feel, not what you think How you feel is a reaction to how you think feelings are not emotions.

[01:27:51] Sue Bryce | You don't conquer your emotions. You conquer your thoughts, and that shifts your emotions. The only thing in your head when you wake up in the morning are your thoughts. Yours. And they might be speaking somebody else's words.

[01:28:11] Sue Bryce | Like, Kate said this about me yesterday. Paul said this about me, but it's your voice. Be your thoughts. And then you're having emotional reaction to something you're thinking about that Kate said about you yesterday, you're having that. Kate's not.

[01:28:31] Sue Bryce | Kate's asleep. You're the one awake. Having the emotion, you're the one stuck in the loop, having the thought, and the response to it. And you're the one then attracting from that inside space. So all you have to do every day is what am I focused on?

[01:28:51] Sue Bryce | And how do I feel about it? That's it. What am I focused on and how do I feel about it? Now you go talk to anybody that's a millionaire, billionaire, anybody who's successful in business and say, if you would wake up back then, in the beginning and say, did you ever wake up and say, what am I focused on and how do I feel about it and get them to tell you exactly the moment where they knew they were valuable? They knew they'd created something good.

[01:29:19] Sue Bryce | They felt connected to it, and they started selling it. Whether it's time, service, digital product, anything, and they love it so much. They sell it without selling. Because I don't have to sell this. I love this.

[01:29:34] Sue Bryce | I embody this. I am this. That's it. That's the magic right there. So every day, you just get up and ask, what am I folks done and how do I feel about it?

[01:29:48] Sue Bryce | And if it's debt and terror, stay in bed. Stay in bed and keep work working on it, but it's your head. It's your voice. It's your thoughts, and it's your responses. That's it.

[01:30:00] Sue Bryce | What am I focused on, and what am I gonna do about it today? And then hit that list. Go through that slide until you like done that. Done that one. Done that one.

[01:30:11] Sue Bryce | Avoiding this right now. So I'm gonna put it over here. Pull that slide out. Put it in a folder that is something I don't wanna face today, or this is what I'm avoiding right now, and then get an accountability partner that's done this workshop and go to them, and they go, I've got 8 slides in my avoidant, do you wanna do an accountability? Cause I just wanna pull one out and just say, okay.

[01:30:35] Sue Bryce | I'm just gonna like this one. Oh, this one. I'm a bit stuck here. But again, until you can tell me what is the problem I'm solving for your brand, what is the problem I'm solving for your product? What is the problem I'm solving for your selling?

[01:30:49] Sue Bryce | What is the problem I'm solving in your marketing? What is the problem I need to solve for your business? What is the problem I need to solve for you personally until you can work that out and tell me I can't solve any of it. And I don't know that it ever could anyway because it's about you solving it, so that's the cool part about this, is it's really about you working it out. And that's it.

[01:31:12] Sue Bryce | Actionable, quantifiable step Every day, I actively participate in the success of my income and my business, and I do that even if I'm just trying to get out of my own way. Hit me with some questions, and then we'll wrap this up.

[01:31:29] Host | There's no questions so far, but I would love to just send it out there to everybody, in the chat and in our audience that you will keep access to the community and to the course page and that today's PDFs will be available to you in a couple of days. So if you have any

[01:31:43] Sue Bryce | questions the community?

[01:31:45] Host | Yeah. Anybody have any questions in here?

[01:31:50] Sue Bryce | Anybody wanna ask a question in here while these guys are typing? And if they don't have any questions, I'm happy to wind it up. Sue, can you share? Your menopause story. I was in transition of my business fell apart.

[01:32:01] Sue Bryce | Anybody who's coming up menopause, anybody who is, like, if you're in the mid forties or if you're being forced into menopause with a hysterectomy or chemotherapy or anything like that. I just have to say that pairing menopause, the 8 years, I was not prepared for it. I didn't know it was gonna happen. I knew menopause was coming eventually, but I didn't think it was a thing like it is now. And I struggled.

[01:32:26] Sue Bryce | I really, really struggled. I wanted to set fire to my business and burn it all down, and I I got very close to doing so. So I just like to acknowledge now online so much incredible information. My favorite follow on Instagram is Doctor. Mary, Claire, and she's now got 2,000,000 followers in a year.

[01:32:49] Sue Bryce | And she's so extraordinary with information, but One of the things that I think that has blown me away about all this menopause conversation is we've never talked about it because we're women, and nobody wants to talk about menopause. But I for I'm going to do a podcast for the doctor in New Zealand who has written a dissertation on powerful women's CEOs that lose their careers during, menopause, and she's been interviewing all these women doing it. And I just didn't realize it was such a big thing. We're talking about hormones ultimately, and, you know, we have different hormones than men, and they don't, you know, the reason they don't study menopause is because it only happens to women. So, obviously, we didn't know enough about it.

[01:33:37] Sue Bryce | Now we know everything about it. You need a good doctor and you need to go and get help. I'm regulated on hormone therapy. It's not, you know, everyone's got different choice, but when you follow Doctor. Mary Claire, information is amazing.

[01:33:49] Sue Bryce | And I just have to say, give yourself a whole lot of grace because more women commit suicide between 4555 than any other demographic, which is menopause. It

[01:34:03] Sue Bryce | is

[01:34:04] Sue Bryce | so heartbreaking. Like, I was having anxiety attacks. Never had anxiety in my life, and I was I heard myself say to someone I have anxiety like I caught it on the toilet seat. And I was not coping. I had brain fog, like, and I couldn't sleep, hot flashes.

[01:34:27] Sue Bryce | I don't want anyone to touch me. I I felt physically violent. Like, if somebody touched my back at a conference, I would jolt like somebody had punched me or hit me in the back of the head. I I would had a very, like, reactive response to touch. I didn't want I couldn't cope with any stress.

[01:34:47] Sue Bryce | Like, before I was gonna go on stage, if somebody asked me a question, I'd be like, you can't ask me a question right now. I was melting down to my staff, to my in front of my clients, and I didn't wanna be in my body. And I feel like I have neurodiversity, so that compounds it. So I got help. I got a brand coach, Jen, and I got HRT.

[01:35:11] Sue Bryce | I take a compound every day. I got my life back, my body back, my energy back, my brain back, and my marriage back, and my business back. And I would've lost it all all of it. In fact, I was yeah. It was fast on the way there.

[01:35:32] Sue Bryce | So, get help. You don't have to suffer through this alone. This is literally your hormones, and it will turn you into a crazy person. You put on weight. You hate your body.

[01:35:44] Sue Bryce | Your hair falls out. I lost 70% of my hair. I didn't cut my hair. I took my extensions out. And there was so much identity around that because I've had WaistLink peer my whole life.

[01:35:55] Sue Bryce | So I, I was really lucky instead of burning my business down at the height of menopause, somebody bought it. And that was a kind of luck that you are very, very grateful for. So, yeah, it is a tough time. Don't do it alone and and you can do it. Yeah.

[01:36:20] Host | Tell us what are you looking forward to now?

[01:36:22] Sue Bryce | Oh, speak, the workshop, already started writing. I've spent the last week writing that. I love watching people start moving and you know, building stuff. And so I get really excited in the next 6 months because people start coming back to the group going, this is what I've made, this is what I've created. That always thrills me.

[01:36:41] Sue Bryce | More in person workshops, having these guys here, because you guys are out there. You're just a little camera at the back of the room and a chat down here. Like, it's hard. Some tie I have to talk and read at the same time, and sometimes you guys talk amongst yourselves. It's really confusing for me because I can see the chat rolling, and I'm like, reading and talking.

[01:36:59] Sue Bryce | And then I'm like, oh, no. You're just answering her question. Okay. And so, like, you know, that's all very much, like, in the mind, but, having these people back in this room made me realize how much I love doing in person workshops, and I don't believe speak can be done online. I think it's an in person speaker workshop.

[01:37:19] Sue Bryce | You have to be standing on the stage, and I have to be sitting down there watching you. So I'm really enjoying I'm gonna enjoy going back to in person workshops this year.

[01:37:27] Host | There are a few questions about speak.

[01:37:29] Sue Bryce | Yes. Well, that you can text, Jen, email Jen, at team@subross.com and ask for the application. She's only just back this week. So who and I were talking yesterday, and she's gonna finish it next week, but we've already received emails. So it is an application.

[01:37:45] Sue Bryce | You have to apply for it because it will sell out really quickly that one, and then there'll be a waiting list.

[01:37:52] Host | Do you think it's possible to completely skip the step of the stinky vase? And go directly to sharing what you do and what you love. Yeah.

[01:38:00] Sue Bryce | Do you have a problem asking for money? Answer that. Do you have a problem asking for money? Do you love the product that you sell? Is it priced with a margin that you'll actually make money?

[01:38:11] Sue Bryce | Because not everyone's stinky. Stinky is guilt and shame, and usually the guilt and shame comes from mom and dad, right? Cause you grew up stinky, I grew up stinky. So my parents were broke. So I was inevitably stinky.

[01:38:25] Sue Bryce | I didn't talk like a rich kid or act like one because I didn't have money. So, I had to go through this stinky phase because I literally was thinking. Now I've got a lot of friends that grew up with money and they can't sell. Because it wasn't their money. Their dad made it.

[01:38:44] Sue Bryce | So they don't have the value, or they can't, you know, so it's like, it's really interesting. Money is it. Can you skip that phase? Yeah. If you're not stinky, I would tell you if you could skip this phase or not.

[01:38:56] Sue Bryce | Do you currently have any problem asking for money and do you have savings in your bank account personal, not your partner's savings? And if the answer is yes, then I'd be like, yeah, you can skip the stinky stage. Yeah. That's you don't wanna be stinky, but inevitably we are.

[01:39:15] Host | If you have 2 loves, photography and baking, would you suggest that they stay under 2 different brands, or is there a way to maybe blend the different things that you

[01:39:25] Sue Bryce | To me, a personal brand, you're the brand. You can be a baker and a photographer and look at the beautiful photographs you take of your own baking. But if you feel like you can't communicate that from you being the center of the brand, then you're not really a personal brand. You're saying I'm super Bryce photographer or I'm super Bryce, donutmaker. You're you're not saying I'm just super Bryce.

[01:39:55] Sue Bryce | Does that make sense? So, like, I am personal brand now. I'm super biased. I make cookies, and I also do this. The brand is about me, but if you make the brand about Subrice as a photographer, you've made it about you and what you do instead of just about you.

[01:40:15] Sue Bryce | So consider that. I always used to say if I opened a website and Subrice was front and center and then I said, for recipes or for photographers, I would choose which adventure I was gonna go on, wouldn't you? But I mean, people don't see it like that. The answer to that is make the personal brand the strongest part. Not what you do.

[01:40:37] Sue Bryce | It's just the second part.

[01:40:40] Host | Ah, I love that.

[01:40:41] Sue Bryce | Yeah.

[01:40:42] Host | We talk about feelings and emotions. Can you briefly explain your perspective and what is the difference between the 2?

[01:40:48] Sue Bryce | Oh, yes. Emotions. So, A feeling is something that comes up. Right? And emotion is something that's deep in there.

[01:40:59] Sue Bryce | That's how look at it like this. A feeling is, like, sadness is undering, but the feeling can be anxiety, but it can come from sadness. So emotions are the core. You don't shift emotions. You shift feelings.

[01:41:16] Sue Bryce | And so emotions are those the big core ones. And you can actually Google the difference between emotions and feelings and then Google all the emotions and then the feelings that come from all those emotions because each emotion has, like, 30 feelings. And it's not until you get to the feeling well. If people are struggling to communicate their feelings, what they're feeling, because here's the thing, you don't say, I'm feeling sad do you? Sad is an emotion.

[01:41:49] Sue Bryce | So you say, I'm feeling blah blah blah blah blah blah, and that sounds like sadness. That's how you get there. So there's a wheel of feeling emotions at the at the base. The emotion is the core emotion So anger comes from sadness. Sadness is the core sadness.

[01:42:06] Sue Bryce | And if you get to anger, which is right out here and go through all the words, the core emotion is sadness. And it's, powerlessness. And then you go through all the feelings to get to the core emotion, and then there's a base core emotions at the bottom. And I think that's our childhood filter. If you get to it, we're seeing and hearing everything through a filter of our childhood, So to me, the base emotion is the filter of your childhood.

[01:42:34] Sue Bryce | Like if there's trauma there or sadness there, that's the base of your emotion, and all the feelings around how you interact with people comes from that place.

[01:42:45] Host | I love that. So aside from feeling just so sad next Thursday at noon, when we normally meet, there are some questions in the room on what are you going to do with this VIP time for not meeting?

[01:42:57] Sue Bryce | Okay. Funny. She said it because I looked at my diary next week, and the first thing I did was saw Thursday was empty and went, ah, and then I was like, because time is so valuable to me. And I wanna take all the time to create because I love creating, and that's where I wanna be. I wanna create, create, create.

[01:43:20] Sue Bryce | So to me, I actually wrote, I wonder if Jen wants to spend, the afternoon with me creating the application for speech so I can get that finished and launch it that day. So I actually wrote that for next Thursday because I figured that I would like really wanna get that out. And I've already started writing more content around that. So I want to keep developing content, but I need to develop content that people need and interact with and that they know works, and I'll just keep developing it. So what to me creating a group of people Ultimately, when you're a content curator, I see every group that I create as a beta test because I'm like, I'm watching the group more than than you're learning from me, but I'm learning from you so much.

[01:44:09] Sue Bryce | And the more you start working through this content, the more I learn, and the more the content develops for me. So I get so like, my creative vortex is insane from now. And, like, today, we're gonna leave and we're gonna go somewhere for a little rat party, and I asked everyone in the room to tell me what steps they're gonna be taking next. And I was like, I'm gonna get so much from that. And then the questions I get in the group is incredible to me.

[01:44:39] Sue Bryce | It changes everything for me. So I just wanna keep developing the content so that I can keep making it better and and then then, oh, no. That's what people need. That's what people need. That's what people need.

[01:44:49] Sue Bryce | Like, that's the thrill.

[01:44:50] Host | If you're building your personal brand and you're really struggling with how to get images of you, how do you suggest you really push past that? What do I put a picture of and how do I showcase myself and my brand? How do you creatively get past that?

[01:45:04] Sue Bryce | You've gotta go to a professional photographer, and, you know, I know a lot of them.

[01:45:11] Sue Bryce | One

[01:45:11] Sue Bryce | of the things that you need to do is go to subras.com, and I and Jen will be able to tell us Jin, on subroze.com, I think it's on the work with me page at the bottom. You can download a registrar of personal branding photographers all around the world and there's 100 of photographers on there with their websites, their names, and their addresses, and they're all accredited photographers. But what is the most authentic version of you that tell you wanna show up in that photograph? So pick somebody that matches what you aspire to be in that visual. And then yeah.

[01:45:49] Host | How do you get past the point when you have so many ideas in your head and you don't know where to start or which one to chase first

[01:45:54] Sue Bryce | Okay. So so many ideas in your head is, avoidance. Yeah. Because you're still not doing anything. And if you have so many ideas, then you're talking about it a lot, but you're not activating it with your heart.

[01:46:19] Sue Bryce | So remember, I know what I want, I have a clear vision, I speak it out, I heart activated, I take action. Those are the 5 steps to doing anything. So if it's I have a vision, I have a vision, I have a vision, I have a vision. That's not. I have a vision.

[01:46:37] Sue Bryce | I'm speaking it out. I'm activating the heart I'm taking action that I have an idea. I have an idea. I have an idea. That's nice.

[01:46:46] Sue Bryce | Why don't you try and create an idea that's for you? And it's something you want. That's when you lock into it and you're like, this is for me. This is what I want, and then I activate that. And also when people say, a lot of people would say to me, the problem is as I just have so many choices and I don't know which one to follow.

[01:47:08] Sue Bryce | I was like, yeah, we all have so many parts of success just open to us that we can pick and choose anyone we want. It's not what's happening. You've got to activate something. You've got to choose something and activate it. And if you can't choose it, then you have to ask why.

[01:47:30] Host | How would you show empowerment through portraits and marketing if that's your service and brand?

[01:47:36] Sue Bryce | Oh, smiling?

[01:47:39] Sue Bryce | Sick. Confidence. Physical confidence and connection. Yeah. Like, to me, that's that's what I would be like,

[01:47:41] Sue Bryce | I contact fully the most authentic, nice, close shot, just just for you. Like, be the most authentic version of you in everything you do.

[01:48:04] Host | A couple of great comments and testimonials. I just love how much you discuss emotional distress and describe tangible manifestations in such a way that we can get through our clarity and really come into our mindset power. Love that.

[01:48:18] Sue Bryce | Yay.

[01:48:19] Host | Another one. Hey, Sue. I have followed you every step of the way, and I'm so proud of myself and created incredible products. And I just wanna say thank you.

[01:48:27] Sue Bryce | That's so cool. I want you to be proud of yourself. It's very little point you're being proud of me. You chose me as a mentor so that you could create under this space, and nothing gives me more satisfaction than watching people create in this space. Like, truly, action for me is, like, It's the most exciting part.

[01:48:49] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Well, so thank you. I want you to take action with those those steps, and I need to know some more. So I'm gonna put out a big survey in the next week, And in the survey, there's gonna be lots in there because you know how I write my survey. So I'm gonna make sure that I put a survey out to you.

[01:49:09] Sue Bryce | I do like that group there being there to ask questions and to share. So make sure you share in that group. There were some personal messages in there. You can message me directly in that group. If you don't want to write what you're going to write in publicly, the thing is about writing it publicly is other people get to read it, but it really makes no difference to me whether I answer it.

[01:49:31] Sue Bryce | Sometimes if I answer a question that I think I could have answered that publicly and it would have helped a lot of people, that's fine. I will sometimes take that answer. Out of the private message and go and create a post and say, hey, guys, I was just chatting with a couple of, students, and this is what came up. And I will bring the answer out. So, you know, that doesn't bother me so much anymore.

[01:49:55] Sue Bryce | Is just watching how it unfolds, and I'm super excited as to watching people start to really, like, build their brands and create more content and step up. And I wanna know what parts you get stuck on and what parts may be because that's the most interesting part to me. Yeah. So a big thank you to tailored media, to Callan, and to Sierra, our crew, because They are here always behind all the cameras making this awesome. A huge thank you to my online right hand, Jen.

[01:50:26] Sue Bryce | I love you Jen. I'm glad you're back. A huge thank you to Melissa June, my host. We were born on the same day. I'm twenty years older, but that makes us the same Chinese style sign as well.

[01:50:37] Sue Bryce | So I'm and Angelina Jolley and Mark Wardluk, you know, so we're special. And a really big thank you to all of you. So I need you to just sit for one moment and ask yourself this one question. Like, aside from what your children are gonna watch you become, and I always love that quote, like, don't expect your children to be more than what you've allowed for yourself. That Carl Young said the most impact on a human being is the unlive life of a parent.

[01:51:20] Sue Bryce | I was like, when I started this, I did everything in my power, not to call this business my name, I had I put beautiful people in front of me, business partner, I gave half my business away, and she was a pretty face that was more confident than me, and I put her in front of me because who was I? Who was I to be successful? And I think back to that, and I didn't have an education, and I didn't have any clue with money, and I didn't have any self value, and I learned it All of it. I learned how to run a business. I learned how to sell from my margin.

[01:52:03] Sue Bryce | I learned how to make money while I sleep. I learned how to grow a team that is a family. That will literally die for you to work with you and be with you. And and I learned that my authentic rough guts self is more likable than anything I could have ever put as a facade I learned that telling people I was poor and uneducated was like my Swan song. And the more I evolved myself, as a person in a business, the more following I got.

[01:52:43] Sue Bryce | Not the more I talked about it, not the more I gave, not the more I did for others, the more I did for myself, and there was a period of time about halfway through SBE where I stopped evolving. I stopped evolving as a photographer, and I stopped evolving as an educator, and I I was getting angry when my students were coming and asking the same dumb questions. And I was menopause on, I was just not in a good place, and there was a time there where I was just like, I'm done with this, and my following drop to, like, 6000 members. And I knew it was dropping, and I couldn't find the energy to reconnect to it, and I couldn't find anything. And I turned around and I said to my husband one day, why did people follow me?

[01:53:33] Sue Bryce | And he goes, well, they love you and they and I was like, no. Why did they follow me? Why me? I'm like, why me? I don't have an education.

[01:53:44] Sue Bryce | I'm not special. Why do they follow me? And and I just stood there and I was like, because I did it. I fucking did it and I continue to do it every day. I get up and I walk what I want.

[01:54:01] Sue Bryce | I walk towards what I want. And I did it and you saw me do it and you said if she can do it, I can do it and that's the answer to it. I was like, that was it. I have to keep moving because if I keep evolving, they just keep following because they're just like, holy. She's a juggernaut.

[01:54:18] Sue Bryce | She's a superstar. Look at her trajectory. Hear those words, those adjectives, a juggernaut, a superstar, her trajectory. She was moving, and we were following her watching her move. And that was it.

[01:54:32] Sue Bryce | I was like, you guys watched me evolve. You watched me take the steps. You watched me get stuck. You watch me step again, and I'm gonna keep stepping because if I don't, you won't follow me. So it's not what you give.

[01:54:46] Sue Bryce | It's not how pretty you are. It's not how polished you are. It's not how good your office space is or your studio space or your product or the price you spend or the clothes you wear or the cars you drive. It's not anything to do with that. It's to do with your authenticity and your evolution.

[01:55:03] Sue Bryce | And the more you evolve as a business and money and a creativity and a creator and an artist, the more people I captivated because you know what? I want what she's got. I want what she's having. I want that life, that confidence, that experience, that income. And so to me, I was like, wow, I spent all of this time hiding in my business and then trying to look good enough in my business instead of authentically evolving myself.

[01:55:30] Sue Bryce | And the best part is every single freaking lesson I've taught you, I learned myself in real time. I learned it. I did it. I lived it. So that's the secret.

[01:55:46] Sue Bryce | Stop trying to be more physically. Stop trying to be, like, more perfect. Stop trying to think if I had this, I would be perfect. It's not perfection. It's not what you're looking for.

[01:55:57] Sue Bryce | People are not looking for perfection. Okay. It's an energy and that energy of evolution is momentum and its power and it is so attractive that energy because I wanna be around people who are juggernauts Because if you're not juggernaut ing, you're probably dragging me down, and I don't wanna be around people that are nay saying, gossiping, venting, practicing their problems all the time. I wanna be around people that are actively walking towards what they want. So you just wake up one day and you just decide this thing, and am I good enough to do this?

[01:56:41] Sue Bryce | Yes, I am. I believe I am. What is it that I authentically want? Is that the truth of who I am authentically? And is it gonna help me evolve to the next level?

[01:56:52] Sue Bryce | I feel like no matter what you asked me about money, I learned that lesson, and I can tell you how I learned it. Whatever you asked me about confidence, I learned each lesson, and I'm like, so you've gotta decide to start walking towards all of this without that confidence and just knowing that this is what I want every single day, and then I'm gonna connect to it. And create the energy around it and elevate yourself within that brand. Nobody else is gonna do it. Nobody.

[01:57:17] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Alright. Let's wrap it up. Thank you. Thank you.

[01:57:24] Sue Bryce | Thank you. I'm not thanking you.
