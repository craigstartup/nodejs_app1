SUBJECT: ▶︎ Watch on YouTube: Discover Your True Self in Business

PREVIEW TEXT: Join me on a journey of self-discovery and brand transformation.

Have you felt stuck, as if your personal brand or business isn't fully reflecting the real you? If so, you're not alone. I just posted one of my foundational talks from the Self Value series on YouTube, and you can watch it now.
 
Understanding and embracing our true selves might seem daunting, especially when old narratives cloud our self-perception. That’s why I want to share with you one of my favorite sessions from the Self Value PowerTalks series – the Identity talk.
 
This session dives into how past influences shape us and how we can step beyond them to fully express who we are. It's an essential step for anyone struggling with their identity in their personal brand or business.

[▶︎ WATCH IDENTITY TALK on YOUTUBE]

In this talk, we'll explore:
 
00:00 - Blueprint on Identity
03:35 - The Unlived Life of a Parent
06:01 - Teaching Our Kids by Chasing Our Dreams
07:25 - The Crave Parent Effect
11:40 - Realizing Parental Love
13:23 - Transforming Childhood Wounds
15:34 - Embracing the Now
 
Special Offer: If this resonates with you, I'm offering my complete Self Value PowerTalks series, featuring 18 transformative sessions, for just $49—a steep drop from the usual $199. I want this powerful resource to reach as many people as possible.
 
Join me on this transformative journey of self-discovery!
