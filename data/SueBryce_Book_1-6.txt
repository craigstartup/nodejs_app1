### Chapter 1.6: Assessing Your Current Brand

Imagine standing in front of a mirror, not just to admire your reflection, but to see beyond the surface—this is the metaphor for assessing your current personal brand. We often wander through our professional and personal lives painting a portrait that we seldom stop to scrutinize. Yet, every successful brand story begins with understanding where you stand today. It’s about peering deeply into that mirror and asking yourself critical questions about what reflects back.

Evaluating your current personal brand isn’t about dwelling on shortcomings or inflating your triumphs. Rather, it's about gaining a clear and honest picture of your existing brand to carve out a path for growth and enhancement. Here's how to tap into the essence of your present brand persona and polish it for a brighter shine.

#### Step 1: Reflect on Your Core Values

Your personal brand should be a reflection of your deepest values. What principles guide your decisions and actions? Integrity, compassion, innovation, or perhaps consistency? List these values and compare them to the message you believe your brand currently communicates. Is there alignment? If your actions and choices aren't mirroring these values transparently in your professional life, it's time to recalibrate.

#### Step 2: Analyze Your Online Presence

In today's digital age, the first introduction to your personal brand typically happens online. Conduct a thorough audit of your digital footprint—this includes social media profiles, personal blogs, or portfolios. Is the content you share adding value consistent with the brand you wish to project? Does your LinkedIn profile echo the professional narrative you aim to tell, or have your recent tweets veered off track? Alignment across all platforms ensures your brand resonates clearly and consistently.

#### Step 3: Solicit Feedback

Sometimes, the mirror you need is held by those around you. Reach out to peers, mentors, or even past clients to gather feedback regarding their perception of your personal brand. What words would they use to describe you? What strengths do they see? Where do they think improvements could be made? Constructive feedback is a goldmine for personal brand growth. It highlights blind spots and opens avenues for enhancement that you might not have considered.

#### Step 4: Review Your Professional Achievements

Your achievements are tangible evidence of your brand’s capacity. Review your most recent professional accomplishments. Do they align with the brand message you aim to convey? Perhaps you've led successful projects, facilitated impactful workshops, or contributed thought leadership in your field. Document these achievements and analyze how they contribute to your brand narrative. This review helps ensure your brand isn't just a façade but is backed by genuine substance.

#### Step 5: Identify Areas for Growth

As you reflect, feedback, and analyze, areas requiring growth will surface. Is your networking circle reflective of the brand community you aspire to engage? Do the content and consistency of your communications bolster your brand, or do they need more
