Coaching Week 4 - Goal Setter

[00:00:00] Sue Bryce | Hi, everyone. How are you doing? I'm sitting today. I've got a small little group in front of us. We have a small group this week in person, and we have a small group next week, and then we go back to a big group.

[00:00:10] Sue Bryce | So if anybody wants to come next, you can reach out. Look, Jen's right there. Jen is the creator of my beautiful keynotes. I send through all my words to her, and she designs them and send them, sent them back. Jen was also the creator of superise.com.

[00:00:26] Sue Bryce | So I saw a lot of people talking about their websites and stuff in the group this week and Jen actually created my website for me because she's team gets it done, and she is amazing. I also forgot to say last week, Melissa Jones, for those that know Melissa, I mean, you all know and love Melissa. Melissa is my dear friend, she's my host, and she's gonna take your questions. So she's the one chatting to you in the chat if you need anything Jen is at her place, but Melissa is here with me. I love questions, and please ask lots of questions.

[00:00:59] Sue Bryce | There's lots of actionable steps today. So I'm an action taker. And just an action taker, but I'm an action taker, even when I'm afraid, even when I'm I'll just scream and run at it. Like, that's definitely how I'm made, and I know that lots of people are made different when it comes to taking action, but it doesn't matter because none of this matters to me if you're not taking a step forward. I don't care that you paid me money.

[00:01:26] Sue Bryce | If you paid me money and you can't take a step forward, then I haven't done a good enough job of teaching you how to take the step forward. Now, I was never fearless. I'm afraid of everything, and you saw me in the beginning when I wasn't practiced, and I wasn't polished, and I wasn't perfect. And I'm still not, but here I still am, you know, enjoying it, making money, and building platforms, and but I did that. So one of the most important character is that you need to fully step into and develop is to do

[00:02:07] Melissa | what you say you're gonna do. I want you from today to

[00:02:07] Sue Bryce | say in order to be successful in this business, I will do what I say I'm gonna do. And if I think about something and I want it and I say I'm gonna do that, then I will do what I say I'm gonna do. Because that is it. The weakness comes from you. The fear is you, but the truth is you don't do what you say you're gonna do.

[00:02:40] Sue Bryce | So that day that I was railing at god, and saying, I'm gonna jump in Sydney, and you're gonna catch me. And Canon left a

[00:02:47] Melissa | message on my phone to be a speaker, I said I wasn't

[00:02:48] Sue Bryce | doing it. I was talking about it, I wanted it. I said I was going to do it. I left New Zealand, moved to another country in order to do it, and I did not do it. So a lot of people saw that as pure action.

[00:03:09] Sue Bryce | It wasn't. I started doing what I said I was gonna do. That simple. Now when it comes to coaching anybody, I want you to tell me what you want, and then I want you to create a timeline to it. Now, if you need to have a difficult conversation with someone, do it.

[00:03:30] Sue Bryce | It won't be difficult after that day. If you need to set a boundary with someone, do it. If you lose someone over a difficult conversation or a boundary that you needed to set. They weren't your friend. Let them go.

[00:03:46] Sue Bryce | If you need to take the next step in your business, do it. And if you can't do it, you made the step too big. You made a step over there, but you didn't give me the 8 steps to getting over there. And then you just went, I can't walk over there, and it's like, okay, but that was like putting an address into your GPS and not hitting directions. You say you wanna be over there, create the next step, and that's the timeline.

[00:04:15] Sue Bryce | It's the next step, and the next step, and the next step. I need to activate my true path. Do it. Do it today. You will never regret it.

[00:04:26] Sue Bryce | Nothing you ever do like that.

[00:04:28] Melissa | From now on, you will ever regret.

[00:04:28] Sue Bryce | You will learn, and you might fall, but you don't fail. You just fall. And and falling is like a bruised knee, and you sit down, and you put ice on it, and you talk to a few friends about how you fell, and how much it hurts, and then you move on, but it's not failure. It's just falling. But, you know, you have to do it, and I'll tell you why this will make you successful.

[00:04:57] Sue Bryce | It will make you wealthy. It will make you courageous. It will make you confront a motion that is trapped inside you shouldn't be because most people have the same emotions trapped inside them and just wanna release it. So I want you to show up for yourself because that's what doing what you say you're gonna do is If you want it, go and create it, go get it. And every time, every time, do what you say you're gonna do, and every time show up for yourself.

[00:05:30] Sue Bryce | You get stronger, you get more confident, and you get more powerful because you're living up to yourself. Yourself. You're the one that gets disappointed in yourself. You're the one that judges other people instead of looking in the mirror at yourself. So if it's all about you, how about you start to do it.

[00:05:54] Sue Bryce | I sort of start with that. I could've finished with that, but you know what? It's so much more fun to start with that. Alright. I'm telling you right now, you are not beneath or above anybody.

[00:06:05] Sue Bryce | You are not subordinate, and you are not insubordinate to other people. You are somebody with something to offer, go out, and start offering it, start doing it.

[00:06:23] Melissa | Do what you say you're gonna do, and you will make yourself proud, and you will you will

[00:06:31] Sue Bryce | blow your own mind. You know, this is it's something really

[00:06:36] Melissa | it's different, but this just popped into my head. One of my girlfriends lives in Dallas, and her church had a

[00:06:46] Sue Bryce | workshop, where you could go in this workshop, the whole point of it was, hang on, I

[00:06:50] Melissa | gotta get this right. It was a workshop

[00:06:50] Sue Bryce | about how to speak to your children, for moms, specifically mum's. And it they started off with this how you name your children's private parts and things like that. It was just one of those classes. And she said that this instructor was so amazing. She turned to all the women And she said, you know, you could call it a PP or whatever.

[00:07:22] Sue Bryce | You give it a Cutey name or anything like that. This is why we use proper name. She said, but mostly, she said, if your child only ever hears them, you talk to them like a three year old, then your child often thinks that you're not much higher in your ability to converse, you know, and they often look outside of you, And this woman said, blow your children's mind with your knowledge. Blow their mind with it. And then when they earn the playground and somebody goes, that's a fee fee or a Fofo, and she say, actually, no, it's a blah blah blah.

[00:08:00] Sue Bryce | My mum knows all about it. And I was like, just that I can relate that to a lot of things, but the one thing I could just relate it to was, you know, we spend a lot of time acting like we're not connected to ourselves, acting like we're not important, acting like we're not enough, not seen enough, and instead of blowing people away with our knowledge, with our skills, with our courage, you know, with our resilience, like blow people away. Stop trying to measure up because the truth is is if people out there are making you feel like you don't measure up, that's about them, not measuring up, but you're doing it. And that's why I think I made so many people angry when I started to do it because people would say, she's not even good enough, and I'd go, but here I am doing it, because what's good enough? That means they aren't good enough to do it, and I was good enough to try.

[00:08:58] Sue Bryce | Yeah. I just I wanna preach that. I wanna sing it. I wanna Okay. The timeline, I just want to address a couple of things about time and the way I visually see it before we start making big business goals.

[00:09:12] Sue Bryce | But one of the things I want you to look at is, you know, when it comes to the timeline of creating the path forward, you've probably learned in the last 3 weeks of coaching, but you thought it was about the product being the valuable thing, and then you thought it was about the experience, being the valuable thing, but the truth is it's about you, and it's about the time that you give. And this is where you start to really challenge yourself because often, and I'm I don't wanna weight this towards mom's side, but mom's doing a lot more heavy lifting with child raring sometimes than dad is. Now dad might be working harder, longer, whatever, and it could be dad mom reversed. I don't want to pigeonhole that. I just want to acknowledge that when you give your time and you have all these demands and you have family and you have children, that that can become incredibly difficult.

[00:10:03] Sue Bryce | But I just want you to look at this. So understand one thing about growing in increments. Like, I used to get $400 struggled too, then I got $1800, then I got 3 and a half 1000. I keep going up in increments and increments, but I learned this, the more valuable I got, the more expensive I got. Alright?

[00:10:24] Sue Bryce | The more booked up I got, the harder it was to get to me. It didn't matter. People just paid more. I put the price up. They paid it.

[00:10:35] Sue Bryce | I created a waiting list. They waited. That's what happened. At first, there was nothing. Nobody.

[00:10:42] Sue Bryce | And then as you just keep going, you keep booking, but what I could not create was more time. Now if you get really expensive, then only 1% of people can afford you, and the other 99% will look at you like a luxury product and know they can't get to you. And it stops your access to people, to real people, and not that the 1% are not real people, but I don't just want people in my room because they can afford to be there. I want them because they truly wanna be there, and they wanna learn and be more. It's just the time thing.

[00:11:20] Sue Bryce | So if the price keep going up, they paid it, I create the list, they wait for it, as soon as you fully booked, you're creating a waiting list. And a waiting list is desire, demand, it's exclusivity, and it really activates any pre purchasing, because I can say to you, well, you have to wait 2 months for that product. It's gonna $3000, and you wanna pay for it today in order to expedite that, like, right there, it never really came down to anything, but my ability to manage the time that I give. So if the product that I'm selling is not making me enough money in time that I'm allocated to do it, I have to be better with my time. So if you have children at school and you are operating this business at home from, say, 9 in the morning until 2:30 pm, you have a shorter amount of time to get stuff done than I do.

[00:12:15] Sue Bryce | I can work 15 hours a day, but trust me, I wouldn't tell anybody to work 15 hours a day because it's the fastest way to burn out. What you're trying to be is more valuable in the time that you have, really, really important, more valuable in that time you have. So I realized that when you prioritize what matters most, every single morning, and you're being super intentional, and then you are really looking at how much you have to give, the key is that is alignment. I'm in alignment with my time, what I'm giving, And this is where you can start creating boundaries, boundaries around everything that you're giving. Okay?

[00:12:55] Sue Bryce | And this is so, so important to me. Time is finite. Once it's gone, you can't get it back. It's the most valuable commodity you have. And especially if you give your energy to children first, which is how it works, because it means it's second.

[00:13:17] Sue Bryce | And if it's second, you have to be very, very careful how you choose it. So remember this comes up, this is actually in every single workshop I have ever done. I want you to change, I don't have time to I don't prioritize. K. That's what I did with the gym.

[00:13:34] Sue Bryce | I don't have time to go to the gym. Truthfully, I hate the gym. It's a sensory nightmare, and it's a place of great suffering. So instead of feeling guilty constantly that I don't have time to go to the gym, or even worse, I bought a 1 year gym, gym membership, and I went four times. So saying I had no

[00:13:53] Melissa | time justified the money I spent, and of course,

[00:13:53] Sue Bryce | that's not my fault, somebody took my time, that's why I couldn't go to the gym. That is just loaded with apathy, with excuses, it's loaded with inertia, and it's loaded with lies, self lies. So instead, I started to say, I don't prioritize the gym, because I hate it. And then people would go, oh, and I'd just be like, well, that's honest. And then they go, what do you prioritize?

[00:14:28] Sue Bryce | And I eating cake. Whatever you want, just prioritize anything. I'd rather dance in the lounge to YouTube on my TV. Shuffle. I can shuffle.

[00:14:41] Sue Bryce | I want I hip hop dance, I shuffle. 1 night, my husband came in, and he was like, what's going on in here? And I was like, tonight, I'm doing salsa, and I just found a salsa class. And I was just doing seltzer, and I got right up to advance moves, and then next I was like, oh, you know, but it was just a matter of just moving, instead of all the lies that I had to tell about the gym and the gym membership, and, so if you don't have time, it's that you don't prioritize. And if you're talking about yourself, I don't have to blah, blah, blah, change it to, I don't prioritize, and watch yourself start to prioritize that one thing.

[00:15:18] Sue Bryce | Now, I always say a daily ritual is how I get to think, but these are the first I just wanna check-in with one thing. Now that you're starting to take action, we're gonna start a daily ritual for your business. But first, I just wanna go back through your daily ritual for yourself, because I just wanna remind you of the first six levels that I hit before I start my business creating Everything here is in my mind, my soul, and my body. So the first thing I do is process how I think and how I feel. Cause if you wake up with yesterday's emotions, you're stuck in yesterday.

[00:15:53] Sue Bryce | The goal is to feel good about my day. Not to spend my day focused on yesterday's troubles. That's gonna create more of yesterday's troubles. So I have to feel good about my day, so processing my mind is the first one. For my soul, This is where you pray.

[00:16:09] Sue Bryce | This is where you journal. This is where you meditate. This is where you walk in nature, and it's where you ground your feet. It doesn't matter if you do that for 5 minutes. If you can take 5 minutes to ground your feet, meditate, prior journal.

[00:16:22] Sue Bryce | It does not matter that is for my soul. And then the last one is my body. Remember, my body needs to move. It needs rest. It needs nourishment.

[00:16:30] Sue Bryce | It needs hydration. It needs replenishment. It needs self care. It needs exercise. It needs strength, mobility, and personal pleasure.

[00:16:38] Sue Bryce | That's what it needs, but what it really needs to operate at its fullest level is for you to feel good in your body every day. Just feel good in your body. It's about I feel good in my with my day that's coming, I feel good with my creative energy, and I feel really good in my body. Right. Once I've done that, I process myself and I'm good to go.

[00:17:02] Sue Bryce | If I need more help, I will go in journal, meditate, or call a friend. But in the next step, the next three, I reconnect to all of my goals, and that's why they're in a book by my bed, so I can bring them and look at them and reconnect them and feel the feeling that I have, feel that beautiful feeling that I have when I see them, and I wanna feel good about what I'm creating. And that's what the goals are. The goals are to remind you what you're creating you feel good about what you're creating, so you feel good about how you feel, and you feel good about your creative energy, and you feel good in your body, and then you feel good about what you're about to create. Cause remember, the top 3 motivators are who you work for, who you work with, and what you create.

[00:17:49] Sue Bryce | Now if you work for yourself and you don't like yourself, well, hello, everywhere I go, there I am.

[00:17:54] Melissa | So sort that person out first, because

[00:17:54] Sue Bryce | that's your most important business partner. And you wanna make sure he or she is set up to win for the day. Right? So I go to my goals, check-in with my money, and that might just be what's the next step for me. Look at my money.

[00:18:15] Sue Bryce | Money's good. I'm at peace with money. Say your gratitude, whatever it is. Just look at it. Take control of it.

[00:18:22] Sue Bryce | Be happy about it because I need to feel good. I need to feel good. About my money. Alright? I wanna feel good about receiving it, and I wanna feel good about managing it, and I wanna feel good about growing it.

[00:18:37] Sue Bryce | So goals, money, and last one is my gut, or my gut instinct. It's so in tune. Yours can be too. If it's out of alignment, it's because you've stopped listening to it, but here's the weird thing. You will feel the the you will feel the feeling in your stomach and ignore what it's saying.

[00:18:58] Sue Bryce | It's here. That's your gut instinct. It's where you experience the feeling place, and you think feeling is in the heart, it's not, and it's not in the head. Feeling is actually down here. That's why we wanna eat it, drink it, cover it up when it doesn't feel good.

[00:19:14] Sue Bryce | So your gut instinct is when you put your hand on your gut, and you say, I trust you. Oh, I trust you more than I trust any voice. And I trust you. And when you tell me there's a red flag, I listen. And when you tell me this does not feel right, I listen.

[00:19:38] Sue Bryce | And when you tell me, something's wrong, something's wrong. I listen. And that's it to me. I'm ready now to go to my work. I process my mind body and soul.

[00:19:50] Sue Bryce | I process my goals, my money, and my gut instinct And the best part about that is my goals are clear energy, and I'm you know I create them, because you've seen me do it for 15 years, and you know that I want to grow my money. So I need to bring my attention to it so I can grow it. So the gut instinct, really, truly, is I wanna feel good about the next steps that I'm taking. Instead of being in that moment of my day, where I'm creating my day, I look over and I go, I wanna be over there, but I can't get there. So stop crying about not being where you want to be and start doing it.

[00:20:31] Sue Bryce | Stop saying, I'm gonna be over there, but I just don't know how to get over there, and actually go, oh, okay, Sue wants me. To draw a line to the thing I want, and then put every step in that timeline that I will need to take one after the other to get myself to that destination. Because if you don't, you're choosing to stay stuck, and you're choosing to stay there. You're just choosing there. That's that's what you're choosing.

[00:21:02] Sue Bryce | Alright. So, When you think back to those 6 things, those 6 areas, which do you need to prioritize right now? Just the 6 areas, mind, body, soul, your goals, your money, and your guts. That instinct, that intuition. Which one of those six areas need your love and attention the most?

[00:21:25] Sue Bryce | Which ones do you struggle to do? Once you learn how to hit all 6 of those points, you're unstoppable. So here I am, in this moment, I get to an action list, right, why do we create an act action list and structure? You're just creating a structure around how much time you have to share. And then you can delegate and outsource all the stuff that you hate because you hate it.

[00:21:58] Sue Bryce | Why would you do it? And then you can tell people how much time you have. Alright. Now I have this theory. This is my theory.

[00:22:10] Sue Bryce | 3 priorities at a time is the rule. Okay. And you only ever choose 3 priorities at a time. For work, you have an action list can have lots of things on it. If it's outsourced by somebody else, and you have to do this email, source that, outsource that, ask them to do this, send some work, you can have multiple things.

[00:22:32] Sue Bryce | But the things you have to focus on next are 3 things. And until you've done those 3 things, you cannot put 3 more things on that list. You will become overwhelmed, and you'll stop doing it. So the rule of thumb is 3. But this is my theory.

[00:22:45] Sue Bryce | Okay. Have you heard this quote? It's actually Randy Zuckerberg, which is Mark Zuckerberg's sister, she said it in a talk many years ago, and she said you have work, sleep, family, fitness, and friends, and you only get to pick 3 per day. Right? So, of course, I look at that, and I'm like, wow.

[00:23:09] Sue Bryce | You really only get to prioritize 3 of those things per day. Now if you have if you work and you have family, 2 are already gone, which leads sleep. Kind of important, fitness, kind of also important, and friends. Now there's something called going through your highest value that I talk about, and that means that if I wanna see my friends, and it turns out my friends also have children that get on with my family, then I can combine family and friends at the same time. That's how you get to more than 3.

[00:23:59] Sue Bryce | But the truth is, is that you have to actually choose every day. Right now, this is my theory. I'm still not at my theory yet. So if that is your personal priority, And I'm not talking about your or going to work is also one of your personal priorities. So this is your personal priorities.

[00:24:18] Sue Bryce | So what will I choose to prioritize today, and how will I choose to use my time? Okay. I want you to choose 3, but I want you to look at my list. So which of these 6 areas were you focused on today? Now I made it 6.

[00:24:36] Sue Bryce | I made it 6, and, I'll tell you why. The reality is you only get 3 per day. So number 1, you can create or work. I didn't want to say work in case some people are creators now, because I don't I don't work. I create.

[00:24:52] Sue Bryce | So you can either create or work. You can move your body, You can choose friends or social time, you can choose play or hobbies, you can choose spouse, family, or you can choose self care rest. Now when I look at those 6, SiF bolded, create work, and spouse, and family. So if you're creating a business and you've got a family, 2 are already gone. So where will you get to create?

[00:25:20] Sue Bryce | And it's just crazy to me. What we're trying to fit in, but what I really want you to do is realize how much of those things you don't have access to right now, because you don't prioritize them. Oh, sorry, you said you didn't have time. That's right. Yeah.

[00:25:48] Sue Bryce | You didn't have time. Or you didn't you didn't prioritize what? What? Okay. So I'm not asking you to take time away from your children.

[00:26:00] Sue Bryce | You can have both. You just have to make sure when you do have that time for you, that time is for you, and you're gonna learn how to stop giving yourself away all of the time and make some boundaries. Make some boundaries around you. So I love doing this because it's really, really important to me, but here's the thing, when I say business taught me, this is what I'm really saying to you. I'm a very assertive person.

[00:26:31] Sue Bryce | But I was not. I never spoke how I feel. I would always sort of just be like, yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. I would never set boundaries or speak up for myself.

[00:26:41] Sue Bryce | If somebody hurt my feelings, I would abandon them. Manny, I'd never talked to them again. I'd just walk away, and it was my punishment when people were instead of going to someone and saying, Hey, you repeatedly do this thing, I would just leave. I didn't know how to speak up for myself, So business taught me how to set expectations, and when you're setting expectations, you're actually speaking up for yourself. To your friends, to your family, to your partner, to your clients, to your staff, to your colleagues, you can say I have this much money to give and no more.

[00:27:14] Sue Bryce | You can say I am available for 2 hours to help, but I have to leave it too. You can say, I can create this for you, or I can give this to you, but I will need this in return. You can say I can support you this way, I can support you emotionally, but I can't support you financially. And you don't have to say sorry for any of those things. That's what business taught me, and then all of a sudden I realized I was applying that to my private life as well.

[00:27:45] Sue Bryce | And now I'm a powerful person because I can confront energy, what I feel like, you know, if somebody's hurt me, now I'd be like, are you okay? And then if they're still giving me energy, it's like, woah, is there something I need to apologize for. And if they're still giving me energy, it's like, what's my part in this? Cause I don't like the way I'm being spoken to. At suddenly, I was speaking out what everybody wants to say because it was everything I always wanted to say.

[00:28:17] Sue Bryce | It was just crazy to me, so it taught me that I could tell people how available that I could be. And it's really great when somebody says, could you lend me money? And I would always say, are you going to pay me back? And if they say, yes, they go, how would you do that? Because that's important to me.

[00:28:37] Sue Bryce | I want to have those difficult conversations because I don't want to wait for 4 months, and you haven't paid me back because I never set a boundary. Yes. I can lend you this money. Can you return it? Can can I lend you $10,000?

[00:28:53] Sue Bryce | No? But let me help you qualify for a loan, or let me help you do the math on your budget to help you get there, or let me help teach you, or let me help you, you know, get that income by giving you creative solutions, but not just giving you money This made me powerful. I never feel taken advantage of anymore. I never feel used. I never feel like people are, you know, overstepping.

[00:29:19] Sue Bryce | It's the weirdest thing. It taught me how to communicate my boundaries. So when you communicate as a business owner, I need you to understand it's a little bit different than being a human being, because you have to be honest? You have to be honest about what you need. Then you have to be honest about what you're capable of.

[00:29:39] Sue Bryce | You have to speak clearly in no games, ever, no manipulation. You have to speak with love when you communicate your needs, and you can also communicate your needs with love. You can say, I can't do that. You don't have to be weird. You don't have to lie to people.

[00:29:55] Sue Bryce | How many times have you told a lie to get out of something you didn't want to do? It's just a little white lie. It's just a little white lie. No, it's not. You just betrayed yourself.

[00:30:10] Sue Bryce | Your soul said, I don't want to do that, and your mouth said, I've I've got an other, I'm sorry I've got other plans. And your soul didn't say, no. I can't do that. No is a full sentence. This is where you really learn how to stand up for yourself.

[00:30:26] Sue Bryce | Speak up for yourself. And it's mind blowing to me now in retrospect that I think of how much I've grown, business taught me this. You know, it's so easy when somebody says, Hey, can you be there on Tuesday to say, no, I have a prior commitment, and it's my VIP client. Who's your VIP client? Do they know that?

[00:30:46] Sue Bryce | No. Is that what you set in your calendar? Yes, it is. And you don't need to say sorry, unless you did something wrong, in which case you need to say sorry. So the last thing I do before I walk into, work into my studio, for my staff, into a meeting, is I connect.

[00:31:09] Sue Bryce | I connect with what I create. I connect to the people I create with, I connect to the people I create for, and I connect to why I create. Okay. Now if you have children, listen to this, Have you heard this saying, he or she sets the mood of the house? So whatever your mood is, that's what the kids mood is, and often your spouse, because for some reason, one person sets the mood of the house and it's 90% of the time, mum.

[00:31:47] Sue Bryce | Go figure. Mom sets the mood of the house. So if mom's shitty, everyone's shitty, and guess what it's mom's fault. So interestingly enough, after I've done my daily ritual, which can be done in the shower, you can get so good at it. You can wake up, spend 2 minutes on your journal, get in your shower, say your prayers while you get ready, and be there for your kids.

[00:32:07] Sue Bryce | But the one thing I'd say is I connect to the people I live with. Cause after I've set myself up for the day, I send them off empowered, excited for their day. Because if I set the mood in the house, then me preparing myself means they are all in a good mood when they leave the house for school or work or life. You know, so I connect to what I create, why I create, who I create with, what I make, why I prioritize myself to choose how I want to spend my time. It's it's true.

[00:32:42] Sue Bryce | Like, it doesn't matter. It's time for you to start taking some time back. Find it everywhere you can, and then be really intentional about that time because I know that this woman isn't probably in this audience today. I met an incredible woman When I moved to Sydney in 2009, my rock bottom year, and her name is Mas O'Connor. I know she's in my workshop, because she sent me a message, and I've already seen her.

[00:33:14] Sue Bryce | And I stayed with Ma'S for 3 weeks when I first got to Sydney, because at the 2 guys, we're both dating, guys that were friends. And they were like, you girls will really like each other. Turns out we liked each other more than we liked the guys we were dating, but but she she was a solo mom at the time with 2 boys, and I watched this woman in these 3 weeks, she got up at, like, 5:30 in the morning, and she had a morning ritual. And then those babies were fed first lunch was made, they were delivered to school. And from there, she drove to hot yoga and did 90 minute bikram class.

[00:33:53] Sue Bryce | Now everybody knows you need 20 minutes in. You need at least 40 minutes out of a bikram class. 3 a half hours, she would spend at Bikram. Now this woman has a beautiful, magnificent, athletic, healthy body, and I was very much in a very sick place. My mind was like, I can't spend 4 hours of Bikram yoga.

[00:34:13] Sue Bryce | That's 4 hours I need to be stressing out about work. So inevitably, I watched this incredible woman then leave yoga. She would get breakfast, and then she would go home, and she would shower and then focus 2 hours just like like powerhouse on her business. Most of it was set up systematically, lots of teams, lots of outsourcing. She would finish that, get up, go walk, pick up her children from school, come home and spend 2 hours with them, just playing.

[00:34:44] Sue Bryce | They would get this playtime. It was intense playtime. It was fun. They'd eat. They'd snack together.

[00:34:50] Sue Bryce | They'd have this incredible time together. Then she'd say it's time for homework and all their chores and stuff, and they would go and do their chores and stuff, she'd make dinner. Feed her children have dinner with them. They'd all pick, something to do after dinner, like, because they're a bit older, like Read a book or whatever, And then she'd put them to bed, and she'd go back to work for 2 hours. And she'd work from 8 till 10 pm, she'd get up, she'd stop, and then she'd shower, go back to bed, and her business just grew, and it grew, and it grew, and it grew, And no part of that at that time for me was even doable.

[00:35:24] Sue Bryce | I couldn't even manage. What do you mean you spend 3 hours at Bitcoin Yoga? That's another 3 hours you could be working. No. It's not.

[00:35:34] Sue Bryce | She balanced her life, her children, her

[00:35:36] Melissa | body, her income, and I remembered learning that from her. And just being

[00:35:36] Sue Bryce | like, she blew my mind. And she's an amazing woman. So thank you, Mas. You taught me an extraordinary, incredible lesson. So, yeah, all the questions I ever get asked about about, you know, next steps are always about burnout, impostor syndrome, when am I good enough to get paid and work life balance?

[00:36:05] Sue Bryce | You have to acknowledge what it is that's stopping you from moving forward. Like, you know, so many people are like, I don't know, and you're like, you do know. Literally a step in front of you because I've laid steps out, and you got stuck on this step, which tells me now I know what's stopping you from moving forward. So let's create actual business goals. Like, yes, those 6 steps to you doing your morning ritual are very important.

[00:36:31] Sue Bryce | But what are your business goals? Let me show you how I break down business goals, because I break them down no different than any other goals. I make it so simple and next steps. So in order to create a path to anything, we need to create a timeline to it. I'm assuming, and you can please tell me in the chat or tell me in the room if you believe if you believe at all that, Wait a minute.

[00:36:58] Sue Bryce | Where am I just read that? Now I'm jumped up here, Okay. You must be working on one of those 6 things. Please tell me if there's another one. Okay?

[00:37:09] Sue Bryce | Because I know that everybody right now is waking up, and they're either like, Oh, I've gotta fix my brand, change my brand, develop my brand, right? Or get more clarity in my brand, like you're either cleaning that up, or you're working on your products, which is either a new product, developing a better product, sure. Like there's lots of things there, or you're working on your systems, which is selling. Okay. Booking, selling, sales systems, booking systems.

[00:37:37] Sue Bryce | That's where you work on your systems. You don't work on selling. Selling is really simple. This is $5. Would you like one?

[00:37:49] Sue Bryce | You'd like it? Oh, good. How would you like to pay for that? That's selling. Say no.

[00:37:55] Sue Bryce | This is $12. Not for you? Okay. Would you like it for $12? Sure.

[00:38:00] Sue Bryce | Sure. Oh, okay. Later. That's selling. Selling is a yes or no, I want this offer of value.

[00:38:06] Sue Bryce | We put too much. It's all about the rejection, right? So If you think of selling as being that easy, then your systems is where you're working on selling. Maybe you're working on the marketing content. Maybe you're trying to connect your marketing.

[00:38:25] Sue Bryce | Maybe you're working on networking right now, and you wanna get really good at it in person. I want you to network in person. Or maybe you're working on the connection. Connection to the brand, connection to the product, connection to the words. Are there any more?

[00:38:38] Sue Bryce | Thank you, Jen. Jen just put that in the chat. So what else? What are you currently working on right now? You see?

[00:38:48] Sue Bryce | Now, every one of those lines should have a goal. Let's write a goal for every one of them. So what is the next step for every one of those lines? That's your homework. Alright?

[00:39:02] Sue Bryce | That is your homework. You're either working on your brand, your product, your systems, your marketing, your networking, or your connection. I could not get any more. I keep going back and going, okay, what if I want to work on myself? Well, that's my connection.

[00:39:16] Sue Bryce | What if I wanna work on developing something new? Well, that's my product. Okay. What if I wanna work on, everything I keep going back to those 6, but please tell me if there's more, I'm not seeing any more, so I I trust that those are good. Please, if you really feel like, oh, Sue, what about this?

[00:39:34] Sue Bryce | Tell me, because it's really important. When I miss something, it's often because it wasn't important to me. It wasn't a struggle for me. Oh, it wasn't a problem for me, so I often overlooked something, and it's I really liked that. Now we're going to, in your homework, create a next step for every

[00:39:49] Melissa | one of those lines. And again, I'm going to ask the same questions. Okay? I'm going to ask

[00:39:49] Sue Bryce | which area do I need to prioritize? Which area do I most avoid? Which area needs my love and attention? Okay. So April, if you're working on product and networking, you can do both of those things at the same time.

[00:40:12] Sue Bryce | You just well, not at not at once. You do one in the morning and net in the evening, maybe, and but I want a goal for every single one of them. And even if you have, like, I have a, you know, I have a business income, but I'm still working

[00:40:26] Melissa | on my brand, my product, my systems, my marketing, my network, and

[00:40:26] Sue Bryce | my connection just at a different level. So yes, let's set a goal for every single one of those lines, and do you have any questions about that? And if you do, go to the group

[00:40:38] Melissa | this week, because I'm in there, and I like it when people bring these questions.

[00:40:38] Sue Bryce | I just gotta break down a options for you because I like to give people choices.

[00:40:48] Melissa | If there are any more, please write them in the chat for everyone to see. When it comes to your brand,

[00:40:48] Sue Bryce | do you have beautiful photos of you? Do you have beautiful video of you? Go and do that.

[00:41:03] Melissa | Make sure you lock down your 3 by 3, and make

[00:41:03] Sue Bryce | your about page so dynamic that people wanna copy it. Okay? That's when you gotta make sure that your social network, your social triangle, and your website are connected, and I want you to go and make a sales page. Whatever you're doing, go and make a sales page that people can link to that directly sells and gets people to make a decision at the bottom, and that is also a system of momentum. So you started off with brand identity and ended up with a system that's gonna get you paid.

[00:41:38] Sue Bryce | Okay? I want you to, look for as much clarity, value, and connection as you can. And absolutely choose any of those and write your own. When it comes to product, you're either developing something new, you create something new, you can revive an old product. You can take an old product out of circulation, pull it apart, look at it, reprice it, repackage it, change something about how it's made, and how it's done, fall in love with it again, and relaunch it.

[00:42:07] Sue Bryce | You could develop content with beta testing, you could reconnect to your products, and get into alignment with what you do because When you do that, you wanna share it, and it feels good, and you can also create an experience because that makes your product of value even better across the board. And the system you would set up around this would be a sales system, a marketing system, and a referral system, because they're all something to do with that product. And, you know, it's easy peasy. If you're working on your systems, those are what you have to do. I want you to do your booking system first, your sales system second, and I want you to build a list.

[00:42:44] Sue Bryce | I want you to do your money management systems,

[00:42:46] Melissa | all of that forth, and then your

[00:42:46] Sue Bryce | marketing campaigns, and your Hallmark holidays. Now Hallmark make cards for mother's day, father's day, birthdays, weddings, grandparent, and for every type of card that

[00:43:02] Melissa | can possibly make is now made. And if it's

[00:43:02] Sue Bryce | a Hallmark holiday, pride is a hallmark holiday. If it's a hallmark holiday, it's marketing. Two things are gonna happen around a hallmark holiday. We're gonna spend an extra couple of $1,000,000,000 on chocolate and red roses. 1,000,000,000

[00:43:25] Melissa | of dollars. So that means that all retailers start marketing their Hallmark holidays. Are you? Now as a

[00:43:25] Sue Bryce | photographer, my Hallmark holidays were Christmas, because that got families together to take family portraits. Newborns. Congratulations. You've had a baby. You're pregnant.

[00:43:45] Sue Bryce | Congratulations. You've got engaged. You're getting married. All of those are Hallmark holidays.

[00:43:50] Melissa | They're beyond just life events that people have. They are dedicated times of the year where we celebrate mothers, fathers. You know,

[00:43:50] Sue Bryce | it's like right there, families, Thanksgiving. These are Hallmark

[00:44:04] Melissa | holidays, and you have to create marketing campaigns around them. So that's why I say marketing campaigns and Hallmark holidays,

[00:44:04] Sue Bryce | specifically in your systems of momentum. Now your client

[00:44:17] Melissa | connection, relationship building, the consultation, or your onboarding system, the delivery and follow through of your product, customer support, rewards referral systems, and anything

[00:44:17] Sue Bryce | where you can connect with your clients, sending them gifts, if they're good clients reaching out to them, building a network with them, having them follow you, and rewarding them in some way. If you're working on your marketing content, focus on, entertain, educate, engage, and empower. You're there to show

[00:44:44] Melissa | off, share, and engage. You're not there to sell anything.

[00:44:44] Sue Bryce | You're there to get attention and be fun or be just engaging. It doesn't have to be fun. It can be serious, but you're there to be your truest energy, so you might as well work out who you really are. I want you to create lead generator videos for your clients. I want you to blog, blog, or create a YouTube channel.

[00:45:12] Sue Bryce | Blog, vlog, or create a YouTube channel. Alright? Instagram is not working for selling or anything like that. That's where you just show off to get people to your blog, to your blog, or to your YouTube channel. And then there you are on video.

[00:45:28] Sue Bryce | Work on that. But I need a goal for each one. If you're scared of networking, your first goal is to go to a networking, it might be to reach out to amazing networkers in your group or in your industry and getting them to help you. It's about presenting your brand, presenting yourself. This is where you can speak for your business.

[00:45:48] Sue Bryce | This is where you create business to business connections. It is one of the most powerful things you can do for your business. Are you avoiding this right now? And why are you avoiding this? Why are you avoiding this?

[00:46:01] Sue Bryce | So I put 2 tips in here, which I really love. Number 1 is you won't leave this. But I was a terrible networker when I first started, because I didn't want to talk to strangers, and I was so uncomfortable in the room. So one day, I met a networking event and I see this beautiful woman. Her name is Angela Bear.

[00:46:24] Sue Bryce | She has long black hair and red lipstick, and she was wearing a pink, hot pink trench coat. She was gorgeous, she was dressed incredible. She floated into this room, and I thought she was on a hoverboard. And she just everybody was like, hi, and she was there and present, and I remember shaking her hand and her going, oh, who are you? And I'd be like, I'm thinking about being all awkward, and she was just like, Oh, tell me more.

[00:46:56] Sue Bryce | And her business was amazing. And she had this cool story. And in my soul, I was like, I wanna be like her. That is a networker. She made everyone in the room feel important, and I was blown away by this woman.

[00:47:15] Sue Bryce | But I was terrified. So I went to a networking event with her.

[00:47:22] Melissa | All

[00:47:22] Sue Bryce | right? And now she's like, Oh, you should come to this networking event because she found out I was a good photographer, and she wanted me to photograph her. So I'm in. Just like that, I all used to love how one of my skills could just get me in a door so quickly, but I know it wasn't just my skill. It was how comfortable I was, and I was meeting her energy, and I was blown away by her.

[00:47:43] Sue Bryce | So I go to this networking event for her, and I try I dress up more, and I'm trying to look good because she looks so good. And I walk in, and I realize that I don't need to do anything. I just took a wing man. This woman walked around the room, meeting everybody the way she did, while I had very intense conversations with one person at a time, booking actual bookings. And every time I'd look somebody would be like, I just met Angela, and she told me I need to come and see you.

[00:48:16] Sue Bryce | Oh my gosh. What do you do? And I was like, wait, I think I just took a wingman to networking. So next time I went, I took my business partner, and I told her everything. I was like, you know, we've just gotta bounce off each other.

[00:48:34] Sue Bryce | Like, I'll talk to somebody, and this is what we would do. So while I was talking to Margaret, I'd say, oh my gosh, have you met Have you met Kate? Smith? And they'd go, oh, no. And I go, oh, let me introduce you.

[00:48:49] Sue Bryce | Cause I can tell that you 2 are gonna hit it off immediately. She owned a business that does blah blah blah, and she does this as well, or she's like, you to wait. And then it'd be like, Kate, and Kate would be like, yes, and now straight away, I go, Kate, I've made Kate important. And as soon as I've made Kate important, the woman who I'm now introducing her to is like, Hi, and I've just made an introduction easier for an awkward person. And so we started to wing man each other at networking events.

[00:49:22] Sue Bryce | I haven't been to a networking event alone in 20 years. Why would I? I have awesome wingman. Now, if I wingman my makeup artist or my videographer or something like that, Can you think that's even more interesting, isn't it? Because then I'm like, no, my makeup artist is here.

[00:49:40] Sue Bryce | Your what? You know, to me, taking that wing man changed everything. And I just still to this day, I think it's one of the best things you can ever, ever do. So I always say work harder not smarter, not harder. Work harder harder not smarter is what I used to say.

[00:49:59] Sue Bryce | So now I say smarter not harder, and it means with more value, so a lot of people get really confused when they say with more value, because they're like, what does that mean? I think it's very, very important that you if you're saying that, that you sit down and really work out what more value means to you. Alright. So, yes, Jen, you are an incredible wingman. No.

[00:50:30] Sue Bryce | You are an incredible wingman. Because well, okay. So what Jen and I what Jen's just saying in the chat is I really think I've had some incredible wingman, like Sue and Terry, but I was like, but you're an incredible wingman to me. So inevitably, the wing man is not the person that just gets you the introduction. You do it to you wing man each other, because you're really just setting an an importance.

[00:50:54] Sue Bryce | So, you know, Bridget Jones, and it's like, introduce people with thoughtful detail. That's what it is. Instead of going, this is Kate, I'll be like, oh, have you met Kate Smith? Oh, okay. I'm already setting a stage that Kate's amazing, and that Kate's got the answer for you, or, oh, I want you 2 to meet because you love each other.

[00:51:15] Sue Bryce | Kate's gonna love you. I've already just paid them a compliment. And straightaway, I have made that so, so easy for that connection to be made. Alright. So in terms of working harder and not smarter, I want you to look at your glass ceiling right now.

[00:51:32] Sue Bryce | Now, I said this last week, and the week before when I was talking about money, and I want you to look at it like this. Can I get up, Sarah? I'm just moving around. I didn't know whether my camera's following. Alright.

[00:51:44] Sue Bryce | So the glass ceiling was when I first built my business, and I want you to create your week like that because time is finite. And we also work around a structure of weeks, right? Monday to fry ah, Monday to Sunday, up Monday all the way through to Sunday there. And then I realized in order to make the money that I needed to make in my studio because I had a a cool service, I had to create that many available

[00:52:13] Melissa | appointments.

[00:52:22] Sue Bryce | Now, at the time, my average sale

[00:52:23] Melissa | was 18.50, and I have created

[00:52:24] Sue Bryce | 12 opportunities for that to happen. Now, mostly I booked 10, so often my calendar would look like this. Like that, booked. Alright. Now I know my average is 10, 18.50, but my average is 18.50.

[00:53:00] Sue Bryce | Some people spend 5000, some people spend 1000, but that was just my average at the time. So I knew that if I had 10 bookings, I was gonna make it to my $20 mark, and that was my goal, my target, My target, sorry, not my goal. My target was to hit 20 k a week, but I then hit to sell to 10 of them. Alright. And those are my days gone.

[00:53:27] Sue Bryce | All of them. And these are for making more money, so they can't be booked and taking the money. So then I add evenings. And then I added morning appointments because I realized I couldn't cope with that. Right?

[00:53:48] Sue Bryce | And didn't take long. Before I was making $20,000 a week. Now, when you're first starting out, all you think about is when will I have the time? How will I book those people? But once you start booking these people, I also learned something a really horrible truth.

[00:54:09] Sue Bryce | I'm working 12 to 15 hours a day, and I'm only making $20,000 a week. I'm also paying eight people full time, And if any of those drop off, I'm in the negative that week. That's a lot of pressure. Alright? That's a glass ceiling.

[00:54:33] Sue Bryce | When you first look at it, when you're first starting out, you're like, how can I even fill that? Once you fill that bowl, you realize you can't go any further. So I I don't have any time to do more marketing. I don't have any time to balance myself, to restore, to replenish. I clearly left no priority to move my body, so I'm getting sicker, and I'm in pain, and I'm stressed out.

[00:55:00] Sue Bryce | And I'm working till 3, 4 in the morning now at this stage, because these nights finish at 9 pm. Now, when I first started, this was the goal. I hit that goal. Turned out. Wanted to set fire to it, and set fire to it.

[00:55:29] Sue Bryce | I didn't wanna walk away. I wanted to set fire to it. Alright. Fast forward to the to the new life. After my rock bottom, I get to Australia, and I say this time I'm gonna be different.

[00:55:45] Sue Bryce | This time I'm gonna set boundaries. This time, I'm going to prioritize myself. This time, I'm gonna be more valuable. So what I did was I put my price out to 3500, Monday to Sunday, I created 2 shoot days. Instead of trying to do 2 to 4 a day, I did one.

[00:56:16] Sue Bryce | 1. Alright? And then I had lunch with them. Incredible. I booked the whole day from, like, 10 till 3, and at the end, we had a big, long lunch.

[00:56:30] Sue Bryce | And I got to bond with them, connect with them. Every single one of them prepaid the 3a half 1000. Right? Now look at this. 2 business models, one worked for me, one didn't.

[00:56:47] Sue Bryce | First one was 6 days, 12 appointments, Average salivating 50, I was taking a gross amount of $20 per week, but I was only getting $50 a year, myself. And I was working 12 to 15 hours a day on that business, with 8 staff, and I resented everybody. I resented all of the people I was paying. When I moved to Australia, Simona came in my hair stylist, I didn't rent a studio. I worked from a loft apartment that looked like a studio, but I could live work, I cut all of my expenses, and I'm doing two shoots a week, which is $28 a month.

[00:57:30] Sue Bryce | Now my business was making 20 k a month with 8 staff, Now I'm alone with a makeup artist that just comes in twice a week for the shoot, and I'm getting $28,000 a month. Gross. So minus my rent and all that. And I'm still getting paid 5 times more. Right?

[00:58:01] Sue Bryce | Now, so now you're going to create a new glass ceiling. I want you to draw out your week and allocate the time. The time for you, the time for you to make money, and do it like this. See it. See, this is where I move my body.

[00:58:19] Sue Bryce | This is where I move my body every day. This is where I make marketing content, which doesn't make me money, but gets me an audience that gets me money, that gets me paid. This is where I did this, this is where I retouch, this is where I outsourced, and I truly started to create the week that I want. Sorry. I was making, 7 k a week in 28 a month.

[00:58:45] Sue Bryce | If I if I said that weekly monthly. Yep. And then all of a sudden, I realized when you create a structure of boundaries around you, and you look at it like this is the only time I have, you have to create a lot in that time. It's not possible. So if you were to work smarter and not harder, what would your dream timeline look like.

[00:59:13] Sue Bryce | And how far away are you from working that timeline? Alright? So it really came down to, I needed to be more valuable. I needed to set the business up for me and not everybody else, and I also needed to make sure that I had time to replenish restock so I could actually give more in the show, give more in the session than I was because I just wasn't. I was cutting, cookie cutting.

[00:59:46] Audience Member | What did you outsource first?

[00:59:48] Sue Bryce | Oh, whatever you want. Like, again, outsourcing is very personal. I master retoucher, so you think I was gonna give that to anybody, but when I finally did, it was the best thing Abe did. So you outsource the jobs you hate doing. Yeah.

[01:00:04] Sue Bryce | That's what you do, because somebody's literally wants to do it, you know, and I think that that's very, very important. I need to raise my prices. Good, Anna, that can be on your goal, on one of your six goals that you're going to set Oh, no. And there, networking, smarter, not harder? Alright.

[01:00:21] Sue Bryce | Those are my 2 business bottles. So what is your current model for time? And how can you tell me you have no time when you actually have see it a current structure around you for time. Oh, that's the thing about being self employed. When you get a job, you go to the job and they tell you how many hours you will work.

[01:00:43] Sue Bryce | When you start a business, nobody does that. It's that simple.

[01:00:51] Audience Member | What if you have to still work a pay job to stabilize your money problems, then work and create are 2 different things?

[01:00:57] Sue Bryce | What's the question?

[01:00:59] Audience Member | On the prioritizing time earlier, the

[01:01:02] Sue Bryce | work prioritize your job. If your job is getting you the part step to the business, you have to prioritize everything around that in order to be able to prioritize the next step. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time? How did you get your clients to prepay?

[01:01:20] Sue Bryce | I'm struggling with booking clients. They pay their decision fee. They love their photos, but they can't afford them. Not true, Brooke. That's not true.

[01:01:28] Sue Bryce | Because if they love them, they would buy them. Okay. And I tell them on the first call in style, the the consultation, the prices, but I'm getting stuck with clients not paying in the end. So You get them to prepay when you're a in demand, when you're b valuable, and they know that in order to get in front of other people, they will pay it. Secondly, you have to when you educate people about it, educate them on the value of doing it, and make it the payment via them.

[01:02:01] Sue Bryce | Would you like to prepay that? And reward them with something if they do. That's one way of doing it, but it doesn't take long for it to start going the other way. Just start keep working with value, and inevitably, you get more booked up, and then you become in demand. That's how it happens.

[01:02:19] Sue Bryce | So one of the things that I see a lot of people make when they start a business is they go and get an entourage And I think a lot of you might have seen me with an entourage at some point and thought she is an entourage, but, like, I literally don't believe you need an entourage. My employees are 1099. They're not staff. Their crew, and they work, and they all have their own business. And I've seen designers, photographers, even a hairstylist, get a whole crew around them that move with them, and that's five people you're paying full time And and what are they doing making you look more important?

[01:03:01] Sue Bryce | It's so weird that we do it, but we really, really do. It's so, so bizarre that we need this this entourage. Now you actually need a wingman, not an entourage, and you need a community that you can speak to online, and you need a community that you can send, blog, blog newsletter to. And you need to create that group because that group is more important than anything else, but you do not need an entourage. And honestly, I have not had an assistant for the last three and a half years in its so hard.

[01:03:35] Sue Bryce | It's so hard sometimes. There are so many things that I don't wanna do that an assistant could do, but I'm not back full, like, full working yet. I'm just getting back now. Now that I'm written all this content and more content is coming, I was like, or maybe it's time, but I could not justify having an assistant in the last 3 years. So stop paying people to show up for you because you just resent them and keep the money for yourself.

[01:04:02] Sue Bryce | And become your own power. You don't need everybody around you. That's really important for me.

[01:04:10] Audience Member | Back to the conversation earlier about socials and how to sell to your audience,

[01:04:15] Melissa | Yeah.

[01:04:15] Audience Member | Do you recommend a call to action on your Instagram?

[01:04:19] Sue Bryce | No. Cause that's selling. Mhmm. A call to action is not selling. A call to action is marketing.

[01:04:25] Sue Bryce | So, yes, a call to action, a 100% because a call to action ultimately would help build you the list of who you sell to. K? And that's really, really important. So everybody thinks that when you get a social media following that they buy your stuff, they don't. 10% sent, and I'm one of the highest percentage turnovers of any instructor on Creative Live.

[01:04:50] Sue Bryce | I am the highest. So that's my conversion rate. Now if I'm converting 10% of the audience, and you're converting 10% of your audience, then those followers are not your audience. They're not your community. They are following you, and they can unfollow you at any time.

[01:05:09] Sue Bryce | You just need to make one post that they don't like, and you are out of the ash. She's gone. Yeah. It's so true. So what you're looking for is to build the list of that small community of people that will buy from you.

[01:05:24] Sue Bryce | And those are the ones that you keep over in the blog, the blog, the YouTube channel Those are the ones you send digital products to that you give discounts to before anybody else. Those are the people you let book your workshops first. Those are the people you nurture with emails, not just, like, sell to them, sell to them, sell to them. Those are your people. Anybody that joins a list are your people, and they've actively chosen to be there.

[01:05:50] Sue Bryce | That is so cool. That's your community. That's who you're selling to. So selling, when you're when somebody calls you and says, Hey, how much to do this? You are going to try to sell them on what you do.

[01:06:06] Sue Bryce | Right? But you can't sell everybody because the whole point of calling to ask how much it costs is that you find out in that moment whether you can afford it or not, whether you value it enough to afford it or not. So if somebody's still doing something, but they don't value the result, you're somehow not talking big picture. Instead of asking for, say, a deposit and then the rest, why don't you just ask for all of it? So this whole process is $3000.

[01:06:38] Sue Bryce | When you book, you can pay for that. It's really that simple.

[01:06:47] Audience Member | Mark wants to know how to demonstrate his knowledge without mansplaining or patronizing his audience.

[01:06:52] Sue Bryce | I just don't mansplain or patronize. That's how you do it. Like, It's almost like just sharing knowledge without patronizing anybody or mansplaining it. All they do is ask questions. What do you like from my work?

[01:07:13] Sue Bryce | When you look at all of my work, what are you most drawn to? How would you like to be photographed? How do you dream of being photographed? If you could be photographed with the person you love the most, who would that be? Okay.

[01:07:24] Sue Bryce | Not your husband and family. Alright. We could do 2 shoots. Come on, like, that's I've done that. But the thing is, is at the end of the day, it's like, I'm asking questions.

[01:07:36] Sue Bryce | I'm asking questions about what you want and what you love and what you think is cool. And then I tell you what I do, Not I don't need to explain how I do it. I just say what I do. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:07:48] Sue Bryce | So alright. My last slide is no. I don't. I have one more, but my second to last slide was Alright. Just wanna talk to you a little bit about digital products, because you might not have thought about digital products until we got to the part where I talked about products, and I did that number 2 in the workshop.

[01:08:08] Sue Bryce | So obviously, you're like, oh, well, what digital products could I make? What digital products should I make? What digital products do I want to make? Because a digital product is making money while you sleep. So if you can allow any time this week, just to go for a walk, or while you're driving, think about it, hold this question in your mind.

[01:08:30] Sue Bryce | If I could make, a digital product, what would it be? Now a digital product can be a PDF, In fact, pediots are selling better right now than ebooks. Statistically a marketing,

[01:08:42] Melissa | word on the street,

[01:08:43] Sue Bryce | a guide, a template, you know, that you can have some pay to have somebody else design that you can sell a template and how you use it, just advice, anything that you could create, anything that would be a lead generator for your clients, I want you to make digital products. And I just want you to take some time to explore yourself. Now, I've noticed I've put that out there a lot, and a lot of people say things like, well, what would I create? I don't even know what I would create. And I was like, okay, well, that's for you to go and work out, because I can't tell you what you're gonna create.

[01:09:24] Sue Bryce | I would never have thought in a 1,000,000 years that Nikki would create templates for emails, but how brilliant somebody needs to create some templates for selling and marketing so that people can just look at those copy and paste responses and just say them because all you're doing is making an offer of value. So you don't realize in your business, What were the bits that took you too long? Don't you wish somebody had created a step by step guide that you could have bought for $15 and downloaded at 1 o'clock in the morning to learn all about this? And then you sell a 1000 of those, over the year, and you just made $15,000. Well, we just paid for our cruise or that European holiday.

[01:10:10] Sue Bryce | So to me, I was like, come on. We live in it's 2024. We sell and download digital products while we sleep. Let's connect to something and start to, like, make things that make us money when we're not there because there's nothing makes you feel better than waking up in the morning to find people who've been purchasing from you. I recently started my studio, my first client booked me, and wanted me to shoot on Saturday.

[01:10:36] Sue Bryce | I'm having trouble explaining why I don't shoot on Saturdays. Oh, no. Do you shoot on Saturdays? No. No, I don't.

[01:10:48] Sue Bryce | However, Friday is my most booked day, because then you get to go in on Friday night looking gorgeous. 99.9% of the time, that worked. So what you're doing is write out your objections, and then answer the objection. Practice that. So when somebody says, but I I work full time, I was like, cool.

[01:11:12] Sue Bryce | You don't go to the lawyer on Saturday. You don't go to the doctor on Saturday. You go to urgent care. You don't go to your lawyer on Saturday at 4 pm because you have a day off. You don't do any of those things.

[01:11:29] Sue Bryce | You don't go to the dentist on a Saturday. You take time off to go and do what you wanna do. How else I would say that was when somebody says, oh, you don't do Saturdays? I would say no. I've Friday, so you can go out Friday night.

[01:11:43] Sue Bryce | I'd say that every single time, no, Fridays don't work for me. They're too busy. I go, you know what? Most people take a sneaky day off because, well, as far as I'm concerned, you enjoy it. Make it about you, have brunch, come on into my studio, spend the rest of the afternoon shopping with girlfriends, whatever, sounds like make it a day.

[01:12:05] Sue Bryce | 99.9 percent of the time, they said, Yeah. I think I had maybe five people say, I can't do it if it's not on a Saturday, and I would not bend and say, okay, I can book it for 6 Saturdays time, but I only do one Saturday a month. And it's an extra $500. Oh, what? You can do Tuesday now.

[01:12:26] Sue Bryce | Look at that. I found your value point. You know, any lie that you've told yourself around why you can't do something is not true. You there is a way around all of it, and it's being assertive and speaking out that that is the absolute one, like 100%. Give me more.

[01:12:47] Sue Bryce | Give me more and give me questions.

[01:12:54] Audience Member | Would you suggest to have a digital product if you're just starting out?

[01:12:59] Sue Bryce | Well, there's lots of digital products that might have nothing to do with what you're studying and something to do with your expertise already. If you can make a product that people will buy, make one. How many of you're holding back because you think your industry won't like it? And when you see industry, who are you talking about? You know, I spent 35 years as a photographer.

[01:13:23] Sue Bryce | The only people that ever criticize my work online were other photographers. I never got trolled by a non photographer, It was people who wanted to be me or wanted to be better than me. It's that simple. So? Seriously?

[01:13:43] Audience Member | One thing that was discussed earlier in the audience was how to shift the narrative and the conversation from what do you have to give to what do people want from you? How do you suggest you

[01:13:53] Sue Bryce | shift that?

[01:13:54] Audience Member | What do you have to share or to give or to promote versus trying to figure out people want to get from you.

[01:14:01] Sue Bryce | Oh, no. Inevitably, when you start networking, the first thing you're doing when you're networking is just being comfortable saying hello to people. It's nice to meet you. Tell me about you. And then your present and your listening.

[01:14:19] Sue Bryce | Networking is most of the time they're going to ask you similar questions in return where you get to then share your highest values and what you want to share. That's really what it's about. But it's not about trying to get your pitch in or anything like that. It's simply trying to make everybody in the room feel important, because every person you make feel important will remember your name. That's it.

[01:14:43] Sue Bryce | That's what networking is. I was having a hard time making sales and still do sometimes doing in person sales where they pay smaller session up front to book and then afterwards for the work. The purchase is small, and I've resented the aspect of in person sales. So change it. You're the boss.

[01:15:07] Sue Bryce | You know, here's the thing. When I first started teaching 15 years ago, I said, our industry would not say what is an anchor price. Nobody would. The most asked question at every photography convention was how much is your 8 by 10? It's all we wanted to know.

[01:15:28] Sue Bryce | So I heard this. I heard, like, 800 people ask how much for an 8 by 10, and I was like, this is my priceless. Use that metric. And the whole world changed in photo. And then people said Who does she think she is telling people to charge that much?

[01:15:49] Sue Bryce | Because those were the poor people that best got the poor mentality. And then the ones that earn more or think they did would say things like, you're doing the super ice system? Well, that's a glass ceiling because she sells packages. And why would you sell packages when you can a la carte? And I would look at people and I go, these people aren't ready for a la carte.

[01:16:11] Sue Bryce | These people are trying to get $400. I'm teaching thousands of people the first step, and you're criticizing it, saying it's a glass ceiling. Well, people even criticized me when I sold one package at 3 a half, and they said, why don't you put your prices up? And I go, because I was very happy at 3 a half. I put it up to 5 a half, and I didn't put it up after that.

[01:16:33] Sue Bryce | I was like, that's what my session is. Oh, and people were like, that's a glass ceiling. And I was like, okay, but it works for me. So people will either tell you down the air, like, you're too expensive, and then they'll tell you, you're pathetic and not enough. And you just go, okay.

[01:16:49] Sue Bryce | Both of them are about them. Yeah.

[01:16:55] Audience Member | In the beginning of ramping up your business, how do you have some level of hustle, but avoiding burnout?

[01:17:01] Sue Bryce | Well, burnout is not putting a boundary around your time. Not setting honest expectations and not getting paid in equal exchange for your effort. And if you can master those three things, you won't

[01:17:15] Melissa | be burned out. Yep.

[01:17:16] Sue Bryce | That's the cut and dry. Sure is. Alright. Ask me questions, because I'm gonna wrap it up at 1:30, and then you can go about your day. This is the slide that I chose to finish with, so while you're giving me some questions and any questions in here, grab, Mike.

[01:17:32] Sue Bryce | Whatever you wanna do, I need you to start saying what you're gonna do, and I need you to do it. Okay. Whatever you say you're gonna do, I need you to do it. Because I need you to start showing up for yourself so that you can show yourself just how awesome you really are. And if you have to have a difficult conversation, have it.

[01:17:53] Sue Bryce | And if you have to set a boundary, set it. And if you have to write out your next steps, then write out your next steps until you see every step that you'll have to jump until you get to that main goal. And if you need to activate your path, wake up today, and do it. Start doing one thing. I put a saying on a post it years ago, and I said I actively participate in the success of my business every day.

[01:18:22] Sue Bryce | I actively participate in the success of my business every single day. I actively participate in the success of my business every single day, and that gives me so much power just straight away. I was like, ugh, and just absolutely crazy how it just the energy inside you and you're unstoppable. I need you to start doing it. Stop talking about it.

[01:18:45] Sue Bryce | Start doing it. Stop telling me you don't know how to get over there and start telling me this steps, and stop telling me you don't know what you want. When you know what you want, you just haven't bridged the gap to it. Alright. What else?

[01:19:08] Sue Bryce | Would you rather create a digital product for clients or for peers? Okay. So for people that are non photographers, I'm assuming there's the photography question. In our industry, which is no different than all the other industries, we will have our rock stars, and, you know, something that we did was I created education for photographers when I started teaching photographers, but I still had a studio where I photograph clients. And the way you market to those 2 things are 2 different things.

[01:19:40] Sue Bryce | So what a lot of people what happens is a lot of people are like, cool. I've got a business, a design business, and I wanna create templates for designers, but I don't wanna create templates for my clients because I do their design, and then you have to create a product over here for your industry. Just be aware, they're independent of each other. Like, you're not the way you speak to your clients and the way you speak to your peers and your industry are different, but there's conferences you can go to with your peers that are away from your clients So you keep your social media for your clients, but on your website, you can have 4 designers or 4 photographers, or on your website as a whole different place to go. And then what it comes down to is the judgment from the industry.

[01:20:35] Sue Bryce | So I also have spent 35 years, I spent the last 15 years being at the top of speaking in my field in the world, and I know for a fact I know for a fact that all of the, like, push and pull and stretch to grow and who does he think he is and who does she think she is is just your fellow peers with envy. And if you didn't have the envy of the people around you that want to walk the same path you're walking, what would you have? And we let the voice and the energy of other people dictate to us whether we can walk or not, but I went to WPPI in 2010, and I walked in there, my husband put on that show, and I thought this is the most incredible thing I have ever seen 16,000 professional photographers From around the world, I levitated when I saw it. I walked in there, and then I went to my first platform, and they got up, and they spoke about weddings. And I was like, that was amazing, but I don't shoot weddings.

[01:21:42] Sue Bryce | So I went to all these portrait talks, and no I didn't write a single thing. Not one actionable step. And I sat there, and I thought these people don't even make money. They don't even know how to sell. They don't know how to market.

[01:21:56] Sue Bryce | They don't have a studio that looks like mine. And I just think I wanna do this. I wanna do this. And I walked away, and I went to the cafeteria, and I told my friend, I wanna do that, and she said, everybody wants to do that. And shut me down.

[01:22:13] Sue Bryce | And what did I say to her? Those are your limits. You just told me your limits, but those are not my limits. And don't you tell me what my limits are? If I wanna do that, I will walk that path.

[01:22:31] Sue Bryce | And I I I remember thinking that day, nobody gets the right to tell me that I can't do something when I just said I wanna do it because they're talking about themselves. She was talking about her inability to get chosen, that she tried and tried, and she never got chosen, but she never worked at it. She never went back. She never tried again. And I was like, you should have kept going if that's what you wanted.

[01:22:59] Sue Bryce | Then you should have walked that path, but I won't let somebody else's limits dictate what I wanna do anymore. And if I look out in the industry to the people who are saying, you can't do that, they lots of people told me I couldn't do it. People told me I was useless. I would get emails in the beginning after my very first broadcast that said things like, you're a liar. You don't make that much money.

[01:23:22] Sue Bryce | Stop lying because the IRS is gonna come for you. And I was like, wow, I have P and Ls. I have profit and loss. I pay my taxes. I was like, it's literally how much money I've made.

[01:23:35] Sue Bryce | People said you're not even good at what you do. And I was like, well, I might not be as good as you, but I'm I'm gooder than most people. And I really love it,

[01:23:46] Melissa | and the people that I serve think I'm good. So what's stopping you? Judgment?

[01:23:46] Sue Bryce | Oh, people will judge you. Yes, they will. People will already decide who you are. It's about them. It's not about you.

[01:24:01] Sue Bryce | Bricken blows my mind. When I start dissecting what's stopping you from having what you want, you're worried about what some idiot will say down the road and that idiot is saying it because they want what you are doing. It's simple. Stop holding yourself back in this business. Stop doing it.

[01:24:28] Sue Bryce | And don't worry about what anybody says about you. You just have to keep coming back to it's really about you, that's really about you. You can say, ouch. It really hurts. It hurt because it's true for me, but I still know it's true for you because you said it.

[01:24:46] Sue Bryce | So take it back, take your back, and I'll deal with why it hurt me. Like, I see people ready to step up, people who are ready to shine, people who are ready to speak on stage, people who are ready to make templates, and you're worried about what somebody might say that you've made something that will help people Listen to help just this is idiocracy. It doesn't even make sense, and it's the most amount of beers that I've ever heard you tell yourself. If you're walking towards what you love and you're making some money at that, but you aren't making enough money yet, do you keep doing the other work that you resent until you are make don't you can't do anything you resent and make money. Like, last week was about falling in love with your product, because you can't do things you resent.

[01:25:42] Sue Bryce | If you resent them, you are living in resentment, and you will get more resentment today, because that's what you cosmically ordered this morning when you had a resentful thought. That's it more of more and more. So what you do is you start to value the thing that makes you money, that you wanna make more money doing. And you create a timeline. I wanna make more money doing this thing that I love, not doing this.

[01:26:06] Sue Bryce | So I'm gonna create 18 steps today that is gonna get me there, and I'm gonna wake up every single day and actively participate in walking those steps until I hit that goal. And then I'm gonna go, why didn't I do this 8 years ago? It's so ridiculous. Like, you're we don't celebrate enough, the milestones of actually doing something. I set myself a goal yesterday.

[01:26:37] Sue Bryce | It was trivial, and I'm not even gonna tell you what it is. I just didn't want to do this one thing. Yesterday, and I keep saying it's niggling at me, this thing that I do, but I keep finding myself doing it. So yesterday, I said, you know, can we just, like, today really confront the thing that you do that I don't want you to do anymore? And I was like, yes, and I struggled.

[01:26:58] Sue Bryce | I had to walk around the house a couple of times, shake it out, bounce it out. You know, I was like, got it. Got it. Anyway, inevitably, I got to the end of the day, and I had not done it. And I just went, go go to the bathroom.

[01:27:12] Sue Bryce | Go to the bathroom right now and look in the mirror. It was just very important that I went to myself. And I just went to myself, and I said, You don't do a lot of things that make me super proud. And I know I give you a very hard time, and I know I hold you to a very high standard. And I know that you often don't live up to it.

[01:27:37] Sue Bryce | And I'm going to try every day to be better to you, but what you did today, when you said I don't wanna do this thing and you confronted it and you did it I am so proud of you. And then I just went,

[01:27:53] Melissa | okay,

[01:27:53] Sue Bryce | it was cool. I just needed to have a moment with myself. You know, it's like, Wife's tough, and relationships are big, and tough, and families are are stressful, and money, and inflation, and politics, and, and just constant, the constant sort of tearing apart of you believe this, and I believe this, and you're wrong, and I'm right. And it's just at our time right now, and I just needed a moment where I showed up for myself, ask myself for something, fulfilled it in myself. And then I worked out, and then I got home, and I was like, I did that, and I worked out, and I honored myself for the first time in a long, long time, and I just needed to take a moment to say Sue.

[01:28:44] Sue Bryce | Look at you. You can do these things. Like, take a minute. Otherwise, like, I don't know what you think. It's not easy.

[01:28:53] Sue Bryce | Nothing's easy. You just gotta get up every day, refocus your energy with those steps, and then start creating that goal of that line, and what I'm more interested in, and which one of those 6 subjects can't you move and create a goal, and which one of those are you getting stuck on? That's what I need to know, because then I can create more steps. To get you out of that. Okay.

[01:29:17] Sue Bryce | It is true. But we've been through many tough times. If you think of the the history of the world, name a time, and the history that we know it, that the world was not at war, Like, there is always devastation, hunger, violence, war. But it's the separating of people that is just so hard because we start to feel like us and them, and it's It's everywhere right now. So all I know is when economies are bad, when times are changing, people need to focus on their own structure and their own systems, in their own self, because that's what makes you feel safe.

[01:29:57] Sue Bryce | And ironically, you can't change the world by worrying about it. You can only change yourself today. So coming inwards when the world is angry and loud is the place you should be. You know, strengthen your spirit because when you have

[01:30:13] Melissa | a strong spirit in a downturn of money, work, friendships, and love,

[01:30:13] Sue Bryce | you have enough to sustain your own soul. The goal this week is to go back through that homework and create a goal for every one of those for the product, for the marketing. And I want you to come to the group and say, Sue, I've created a strong next step goal. And it has to be the next big step. And if you can't take it out of fear, break it down.

[01:30:41] Sue Bryce | And if you can't take it, because it's too big, break it down. One bite at a time. Every line gets a next step. By the end of the month, you're gonna see which steps you've taken and which steps you have not taken. You're going to see which areas are moving forward and which areas are stuck.

[01:30:57] Sue Bryce | You're going to see where the money gets stuck in your business, and let me just bring you back to the slide. Now Jen has created these slides for you to download she puts it in the group so that you can download all of them. And I'm sure she also puts them in the I don't know in the what do you call that? On the website. Sorry.

[01:31:16] Sue Bryce | It's gone. Interfacing. No, no word. Okay. So once you create a next step for all of those, it's gonna be really super interesting to me.

[01:31:27] Sue Bryce | Let's put self value, on the connection. Yes, it did. Valu and Clari Okay. Cause I was like, didn't put value up there. To me, selling is a system.

[01:31:38] Sue Bryce | If you're working on the connection of the product to make it more valuable, then you can also do that with So, technically, you can put connection value and clarity through all of those. You could. Do I have connection with my brand? Do I have clarity about what I who I am and what I do, and do I have value? Do I have connection with my product?

[01:32:00] Sue Bryce | Do I have value? Do I have clarity? Do I have connection with my systems? Do I have value? Do I see what I mean?

[01:32:04] Sue Bryce | You could actually put it, but I also see connection is the part where you are in alignment in your business, with what you do, and who you are, and what you're creating. And now you can actually see if you feel I just don't feel that connection. I don't feel the value. But breakdown, maybe you feel value in so maybe you feel value in your networking, but you don't feel value in your product. And then I find out, no, that wouldn't happen.

[01:32:31] Sue Bryce | I'll tell you why that's not gonna happen. Networking, you're selling yourself, and a product you're selling something you've made, and those two things are gonna be the 2 hardest things for you to sell. So I would put maybe Miranda, I have no.

[01:32:44] Melissa | Do it with all.

[01:32:44] Sue Bryce | Go through all three. If you're getting to the next level

[01:32:44] Melissa | in your business where you're kind kind of stepping it up,

[01:32:55] Sue Bryce | I talk a lot about fear and what holds us back, but a lot of people say to me, can you talk more about growing an 8 a 9 figure business? And I was like, cool, can we just get everyone to 8? Figures first, and if you're ready for 9 figures, that might have to be a next step with me. But if you're already at 8 figures, you know how to get to 9, create a structure, and a next step around each of those But if it is 9 figures that you're going towards, you're going to need a a growth team, because you cannot do that on your own. Not even with staff.

[01:33:30] Sue Bryce | You need a team dedicated to growth. Growth specialists. K. Any more questions there for me? Oh, no.

[01:33:40] Sue Bryce | Thank you for saying thank you. Jen does all the work on the slides. I just write the words, and she makes them look so pretty. And I used to have the ugliest slide shows before before she did that, and one day I just said, Ken, would you be able to design my kinoats? And she was like, yep?

[01:33:56] Sue Bryce | I think you do them on camper, right, Jen? Or basically, I said these are my colors. I'm black, cream, and gold. Then my colors always have been even my house is black cream and gold. It's just my colors.

[01:34:09] Sue Bryce | So it's like, I like it. What did you get from today? Do you feel like you're starting to confront this idea that you can do anything? Yeah? And that there's really nobody stopping you other than yourself and what you think you're hearing around other people.

[01:34:27] Sue Bryce | So if you think you can't do something, just remember this. I left school the day I turned 15. Alright. The day I turned 15, so that was my 2nd year of high school. I was a child, and I went out into the workforce.

[01:34:46] Sue Bryce | And there was no evidence to me, up until I was maybe thirty years old, that I could even have my own business. That was not even an option for me. So the fact that this girl with no education was like I can start a business, and I learned how to do it means you can do whatever you choose to put your mind to, and whatever path is most lit up for you is the one that you will walk. Yeah. Alright.

[01:35:17] Sue Bryce | Any questions there?

[01:35:19] Audience Member | Yeah. Mitsy just added 1. Sue, I'm still overwhelmed by all the things I need to do. I believe I can do them. I just need help prioritizing.

[01:35:27] Sue Bryce | Right? So go back to the start of the session and pick 3. Go back through that daily ritual of priority and work it like a system every single day. That's how you do it. It's the only way you can do it.

[01:35:40] Sue Bryce | One thing at a time, one step at a time, one bite at a time. Yeah. Thank you so much. I love the feedback. I like the questions in the group.

[01:35:49] Sue Bryce | I really like the questions in the group because they help me so much create more content and get more ideas. I work on a level of I listen to the chat. I watch the chat. I hear the chat. I feel the chat.

[01:36:02] Sue Bryce | I listen to the group. I hear the questions. I feel the way people respond and ask questions. It's very important to me because I read so much in the language. Around what you're asking, and it helps me create more.

[01:36:14] Sue Bryce | And then when I leave today, I leave today, and I'll write next week's today and tomorrow because it's almost like it comes up and out, and I trust that, and that comes from you. So, you know, sometimes it's, like, easy just to be quiet and not ask the questions, but that's what that group's for, and you've got me in there. Yeah. So it makes you go in and I check it every day. So bring me your questions.

[01:36:42] Sue Bryce | They help me, and thank you so much for your energy, and thank you for your time. I want you to constantly, like, make goals for your business because every day when you open your business book, after your morning after you process your your daily ritual, you're honestly gonna say, what am I working on today? Am I working on my systems? Am I working on my marketing? And if you have accountability friends that work in the same industry or other industries, call them and say, what's your product goal this month?

[01:37:13] Sue Bryce | Do you have a product goal? Do you have a systems goal this month? What systems are you refining? Okay. Yeah.

[01:37:18] Sue Bryce | I was thinking I might actually work on, networking this month. And start getting real actionable plans for getting stuff done in all areas, all of those areas, you will get paid. And then you will be starting a business. Thank you, Mas, So Ma's O'cona is Marion O'cona in the chat with the orange hearts is the story I told of my friend in Australia. And, you know, Ma'S, it's so funny.

[01:37:48] Sue Bryce | I started doing yoga, hot yoga, and I I actually messaged Maiz and told her, I started doing hot yoga and every single time I went, I thought about I was like, I just think of my friend Maiz and how she owned her body, and she owned her time. But the best part was, I know Maers probably won't mind me saying this, but when she got divorced, she had to start a business. She had to support her children. She had to run her life. And when she left her marriage, her body had fallen apart.

[01:38:18] Sue Bryce | It was sore and achy, and she was not in a good healthy place. So the fact that she chose to do her income, her business, her children, her body, and all of that, that was for her. That was the most beautiful example of a woman's resilience that I have ever seen and I loved that. And I met her in 2009, so I'm so glad you're here, miss. You're also a dynamic business creator, so I can't wait to see what you're working on right now.

[01:38:46] Sue Bryce | Thank you, Jen. Thank you, Melissa. And Talk to me in the chat. Alright. Thank you, everyone.
