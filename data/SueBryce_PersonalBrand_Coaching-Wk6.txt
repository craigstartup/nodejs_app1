Coaching Week 6 - Brand Focus Group

[00:00:02] Sue Bryce | Start your dancing. I do my dancing before.

[00:00:04] Sue Bryce | It's all my nervous energy. Hi, everybody. I would just like to say we don't have my beautiful Jen in the

[00:00:04] Sue Bryce | chat today because she got a family emergency. So I had to do my own keynote today, which means it's super ugly again, and you've been, like, so spoiled. I even tried to put some color into it. I was like, you know what? I don't wanna make it too hard.

[00:00:26] Sue Bryce | I like lift Jen's borders and everything, but as I started to do it, I'm like, I'm not gonna spend time making this look pretty. And so

[00:00:31] Sue Bryce | sorry for the ugly keynote. We're gonna get Jen back

[00:00:37] Sue Bryce | and when Jen comes back, I'm just gonna have her fix it so that you guys can get a much better keynote. I wanna talk to you about surveying clients because surveying an audience of people is the fastest way for you to get data. So I wrote in this week's session, we're diving into the art of feedback. Nobody likes asking for feedback. You know, one of the weirdest things about, my husband that creates these big events, WPPI, and the portrait masters, He walks around the show, and he asks every single person, what did we do right, and what did we do wrong?

[00:01:11] Sue Bryce | And then he comes and tells me, and I'm like, just tell me what we did right. And he goes, but we've got to know what we do wrong. And I was like, no, you don't. When you're on stage you don't want to know, and he goes, but it is. It's what you have to know.

[00:01:25] Sue Bryce | And I was like, it's the hardest part, and so what we're doing is we're going to ask our clients for feedback, and we're going to build a network of people that can give us feedback. And let me teach you how to do that, but I think one of the craziest things about feedback is we all operate from a fear of rejection, so nobody wants to come from a what am I doing wrong place, right? Oh, what am I doing wrong? But what you don't get when you don't ask for feedback is you don't understand what you're doing right, and don't expect that everybody's going to come up to you and tell you what you're doing right, because when they do want to come and talk to you, most people want to talk about themselves. Okay?

[00:02:06] Sue Bryce | So they wanna talk about

[00:02:08] Sue Bryce | themselves because they've heard your story, and now they get to tell you their story,

[00:02:08] Sue Bryce | and so you get to hear their story, but I really want to like create this amazing community and network around me, and I know that it's really about, it's hard when you have an audience out there and every one of them want to spend personal time with you. So why do we survey people? It's really simple. It can be anonymous. So yes, you will see the email address come in, but if you set up an anonymous survey, people will be more honest with you.

[00:02:44] Sue Bryce | Right? So the whole point about that is if people make the effort to fill it out, they're either going to really like you or really hate you, but they're not gonna take the time to fill it out if their experience was somewhere in between. We know that when people are angry, they speak forcefully, and it comes out

[00:03:04] Sue Bryce | very confidently just because they're angry, but it doesn't translate the same when people like you to go and give

[00:03:04] Sue Bryce | you a positive review. So a survey gives the opportunity for them to be very honest with you over a message email that they may not have said to your face, but we're really surveying for 3 things. We want feedback. We want data points that we can market with. And we really wanna nourish a testimonial out of these people.

[00:03:34] Sue Bryce | And the fastest way to get those things is to ask for them, but these are the two things that when you're surveying that are really the most important thing, it's for you to understand how these clients experienced you and

[00:03:47] Sue Bryce | your product and your service. Like, how are they

[00:03:47] Sue Bryce | experiencing it? Because if you get feedback that is like every time I come to this group, blah blah blah, every time I tell people I'm part of this group, you're getting information as to why they want to be part of your community, part of your following, part of your membership, and that's something you don't understand because you don't know how good you are.

[00:04:13] Sue Bryce | You don't. You're so focused on being good enough. You have not, you have not worked out how good you are at what you do. So this is also to understand how your clients see

[00:04:17] Sue Bryce | you they see you as an entity. They don't see you just as another person. They see you as somebody doing things. Some people see you as somebody doing something they want. Some people see you as someone living their dream.

[00:04:40] Sue Bryce | Some people see you as someone, why are they even getting attention? It doesn't matter, but what they're saying in you, and they tell you, and when you hear that for the first time, you're like, Now, most people come up to me and go, super. It's so glad to meet you. I know you hear this all the time, but I think you're amazing, and I'm like, where do I hear that all the time? Do you think I hear that all the time on Instagram?

[00:05:04] Sue Bryce | People aren't writing, you're amazing. I mean, some people do once or twice, you're so amazing, but it's not like It's not real. It's not good feedback. It's not real feedback, and it's not even based on a truth for me. So I'm always like, where do you think I'm getting all this positive feedback from when mostly what I'm getting is criticism?

[00:05:22] Sue Bryce | So we ask for feedback because you don't know how good you are. You don't know how good you are. Now remember back in my business, 2006, I created a network of small businesses that I could market with called the brunettes in New Zealand. It was when I had my portrait studio, they were all amazing women, they were eight of them. I took 5 of those women, and we created this focus group around my brand and around me taking the next steps out of my portrait business onto an international stage.

[00:05:55] Sue Bryce | So I wrote create an evening, you know, this is what you're gonna do. This is how you can do the focus group. So this is like a face to face survey, but it's more like a focus group. Now, I said create an evening because I want you to do it in person, but you could actually zoom people into this, because if you have the right people in the room, you know, maybe 1 or 2 people can come in on zoom. But I would prefer it to be in person, why you're gonna feel a lot more truth.

[00:06:25] Sue Bryce | I would love it if it's your brand to do it in your space, because

[00:06:28] Sue Bryce | there's something about, like, I'm doing this in my studio or

[00:06:28] Sue Bryce | my art space or my space because it's about my brand, and I wanna really have you feel my space, and I think in person is incredibly strong. So I wrote create a group, create an evening, create a network, I wrote create a show, because as soon as I tell you what this focus group is, I can hear George and Craig going. That sounds like a show. That sounds like a show, and it could be a show, because all of this stuff is so incredibly interesting to everyone. So I want you to imagine this.

[00:07:07] Sue Bryce | I want you to imagine that you create an evening for five people, okay, and you could be number 5 or you could be number 6, but a small group would be better. Everybody positioned in this room is either a close friend of yours, client of yours, or

[00:07:22] Sue Bryce | somebody in your network, an associate,

[00:07:22] Sue Bryce | an associate person in the same industry, or just somebody in your business network that has chops around maybe you choose people who have who have marketing chops, maybe you choose people who have systems chops. Like, whatever you think you need in this focus group, make sure you choose the right person. Now the first thing everybody asks me is, do we pay them? How do we get them to show up? And there's lots of ways you can do this.

[00:07:51] Sue Bryce | Because if I was gonna do it, I would have a wine and cheese evening, and I would say, I'm buying sushi, wine and cheese for 5 extraordinary people, and I would reward them in some way, or pay for a chef's table, pay for it because what you're about to get from these people will blow your mind, and it will change your business. Let's come back to rewarding them later, and let's just talk about what we're gonna get from these people and why. For starters, do any of you out there right now feel uncomfortable that I ask you to create an evening where you're in the hot seat and everybody in the room is solely there to focus on you and your brand and your next steps. Does that make you feel excited, uncomfortable, deeply terrified? Does that make you feel cited and filled with enthusiasm, like, I just say it, and I'm getting goosey because I cannot wait to do this, because I know this one thing.

[00:08:52] Sue Bryce | I've got my questions prepared. You're gonna get your questions prepared today. You're going to know exactly what you want to know from these people by the time you walk out ahead today. Now you've got to get into this group. Now I don't want to go to an event where we're all focusing on our businesses at the same time.

[00:09:09] Sue Bryce | I want all eyes on my brand for a certain period of time. Now, if we're gonna do two people in one night, there has to be a clear cutting of my brand, a break, and then a new come back to the table with this new brand because I need all of this mastermind to come into this, like, just at this, what have we got? And we're listening to you. We're listening to the authenticity coming out of you when we talk about your market We're listening to your words when you're talking about your products. We're listening to you talk about your money and what's going on there and what you're attracting, what you're not attracting.

[00:09:48] Sue Bryce | We're we're talking to you about how we see you outside of you and saying it back to you Nothing will be more transformational as a business. The biggest feedback I got from last week's coaching was I've never positioned myself

[00:10:02] Sue Bryce | in any way, and that is why people

[00:10:03] Sue Bryce | want to become speakers and coaches because they believe that that positions them at something a little bit higher than what they're already doing, and you're not positioning yourself with your 3 by 3, you're not positioning yourself with your about page, and you're not positioning yourself by claiming those nouns of I am a speaker, I'm an educator, because you've got to do what you say you do, and that positioning is so vital, and it's something we don't do because we just sit back and we go, you know, I won't stand out or anything. I'll let people discover me because that's a great business model. Be discovered by other people and have them pay you. It does not work unless you're, you know, an incredibly talented singer, or something. It does happen for some people.

[00:10:56] Sue Bryce | So when do you ask for help? When do you get where do you get creative inspiration? Like, once you're a business owner, there's not many people helping you. You're helping everybody else. You're solving all these problems for everyone else.

[00:11:13] Sue Bryce | You're creating all the stuff for everyone else. When do you say, how do I take the next step? So you come to a surprise workshop because she'll align me, and she'll tell me how to take the step, but I can't talk to Sue. I'm in another country in the world. I need Sue to just be here, but if I was here, if you got me 1 on 1, write down, write down, what time would you spend with me?

[00:11:38] Sue Bryce | What could I do for you in 10 minutes, 20 minutes an hour that will help you right now? Write down the one thing you would come to me with right now. That's what this group is going to solve because I can't be there for everybody, but you know what? I know that once you work out what it is that you will ask me, you will know that you can create this as a system and a network around you. So when do you ask for constructive critique and get it, like, real constructive critique, not criticism, or, you know, not blanket critique, but when somebody can really just look at you and, and you can hear it and take it from them without feeling defensive or going to ego.

[00:12:25] Sue Bryce | When do you put the spotlight on you and on your business and say, how can I improve this? How can I get to the next level? So when I met Jen, bum, she's not here today, but I'll talk Jen up every week. So when I first met Jen, we did a consultation call as my brain coach, because I'm neurodiverse, and I need help. And I was deep in menopause, and I was having massive panic attacks and I could not work.

[00:12:52] Sue Bryce | I was starting to fall apart. My world felt like it was falling apart. And she said to me, what can I do for you and your brand? And I said, I want you to take me to the next level. And she said, okay.

[00:13:08] Sue Bryce | She later showed me her notes, and she wrote she wants me to take her to the next lever, whatever the fuck matters. Because she was like, how does she think I'm gonna take it to the next level. And I was like, because you bring something to me that I don't have, you bring systems, you bring grounding, you bring knowledge, and she's changed my world because I went for the one help that I didn't have, and she absolutely filled that gap for me and my brand. So what would I ask for? What would you ask me for?

[00:13:47] Sue Bryce | That's what you're gonna ask this group for, and I'll tell you what you're gonna ask me for. I know this because you all ask for the same thing. So wait a minute. Let me just finish this. So this focus group, each week, someone's going to take the hot seat.

[00:14:09] Sue Bryce | So if you did four people or five people, you could do this in 5 weeks. If you focused on one business, a week, and you've got to guarantee that those five people will show up for all 5 weeks because they can't just get their week and then not show up. You also have to understand that those five people need to contribute to the other 4 people's business as much as they've contributed. So you really have to pick and choose who this focus group is going to be because it's very, very important. I also need you to understand that if if it's about brainstorming if it's about feedback, you're gonna have to ask real clients to be there, which is awesome, because you always get a really good client that you become friends with, that you end up networking with, bring them.

[00:14:56] Sue Bryce | And also, this offers the power of multiple minds, okay, multiple minds helping to elevate one business at a time, but also we have multiple skill sets. Like, straight away, Mine's content, right? I'm looking for authenticity, I'm looking for content, and I'm looking for a true path. Now, if you put me in a focus group, I'm laser focused on watching you, talk about your business, and I will just be like, vroom I don't believe you. Cause that's what I'm there for.

[00:15:33] Sue Bryce | I want to feel it, and I'm the feeling person in the group. So, you know, you've really gotta identify when you do it, how many people and what they're bringing to the table, what is your superpower? What do you identify in your brand as your superpower? What do you identify in others as your superpower? Because if you think about it and you can build this mastermind of people, then imagine if you built a panel mastermind of people that anybody could come to.

[00:16:01] Sue Bryce | That's a show. That's like Shark Tank, when you've got 5 incredible solar perneurs, just sitting there pulling apart one brand. Alright? And also, when you say I'm ready and I'm good, and I'm this, and I'm ready to put myself out there, if it came down to it, would you be ready to go in that hot seat and put the business that you currently have with how you're operating, how you're talking about money, how you're marketing, and would you be prepared now to go and put that in that hot seat knowing full well that you have to put your money where your mouth is? Right?

[00:16:39] Sue Bryce | Cause it's exciting, because it makes you realize, okay, if I'm gonna do this seriously, then I need to take some steps that are gonna get me here, and I want So just so you know, after 35 years of being in, my career, and I was creating this focus group next week, and I'm the first one in the hot seat. I would be nervous. Sue would be nervous as a person, because I'm about to tell you what I really want. And I know how hard that is for you to tell me what you really

[00:17:15] Sue Bryce | want.

[00:17:21] Sue Bryce | Right? So I know what it feels like to evolve my brand. I have had 4 evolutions. I was a photographer first, then I was a business owner of a photography and makeup room. So even though I was still a photographer, my identity shifted significantly when I built that business.

[00:17:43] Sue Bryce | I was the manager of staff. I had eight people to pay. I was not a photographer anymore. I was a photographer slash business owner, and it came with an entirely new identity. When I left my business to become an educator, I was still an educator at a photographer, but now I introduced an entirely new part to my brand, Educator, And that started to dominate the photography, which was the point, so that entire identity shift as an educator and a photographer was a whole new person.

[00:18:20] Sue Bryce | Then once I established myself as an international photographer

[00:18:25] Sue Bryce | educator that was traveling the world, teaching in person workshops, I did my

[00:18:25] Sue Bryce | very first digital online class in 2012, and that put me into a world of broadcasting. I've spent the last 12 years broadcasting, podcasting, and that gave me an entirely new identity. I've had 4 evolutions of identity, and every single time I needed that focus group to tell me who I was. I needed that focus group to tell me who I was because every time I went to step, it would go blank, and I'd suddenly would not see it. The path would go blank, and I would just suddenly be alone.

[00:19:13] Sue Bryce | And I'm like, I can't see the next step. I can't see it. I can't feel anything. It's like, you start to curate the step, and then all of a sudden it's like this big step and it goes blank. You are meant to go blank.

[00:19:31] Sue Bryce | It is the moment you have let go of the last identity. And now the new identity is forming in the doing, it's forming in the action you're taking down here. It's not formed in the vision. It's formed in the doing of it. And as you're leaving the old identity of I was a photographer and an educator, but now I'm becoming a broadcaster, and and then, of course, the criticism online is in.

[00:19:53] Sue Bryce | She thinks she's a broadcaster now, which I am, and I'm making money from it. So yeah. And every evolution, every identity change, I was pulled apart. I didn't know who I was. I was desperate for validation, I was desperate for help.

[00:20:11] Sue Bryce | And if I could have talked to Sue Bryce, in that moment, I would've gone up to her, and I would've said, tell me who I am, tell me what I want, tell me where I'm going, and Suebras would've looked at me and said, honey. If you don't know that, You're not taking another step, but it still went blank. I stand at a crossroads before

[00:20:31] Sue Bryce | you today. I met a crossroads in my career.

[00:20:41] Sue Bryce | I need a focus group, and I need help. And you do too. So let's do this. Because this is what makes a community

[00:20:56] Sue Bryce | and a network so powerful. So I know if you could talk to me, if you

[00:20:56] Sue Bryce | could talk to me, and you could ask me anything, you would tell me what's going on right now in your life, and you would definitely tell me why you can't move on the next steps. You would skirt around what you really want. You would you would be like, I don't know. This is happening, and and I don't know what's going on right now, but like, I feel you would tell me where you feel stuck. But I know this.

[00:21:34] Sue Bryce | I know that you're doing this. So what I do is I start asking a series of questions, and there's about 10 questions that I ask that bring you to alignment with what you're saying and what you really want, and I start to go after that. Because if somebody says to me, I

[00:21:51] Sue Bryce | don't know what I want, I say yes, you do.

[00:21:52] Sue Bryce | Yes, you do. You do know what you want, because you know what you don't want, and you just start there, and that's knowing what you want. Alright? So I don't accept, I don't know what I want, and I would not let someone come to my focus group, who does not know what they want, because I need you to walk into this focus group with 5 powerful people and lay it out. This is what I want.

[00:22:25] Sue Bryce | And you've gotta be able to own that and and say, come on, these people are gonna help me bridge the steps to get here. This is so important, and you know what you don't want. So most people are really just hedging because they're like, can I do that? Is it permission? Like, can I do that?

[00:22:47] Sue Bryce | Can I be that? Can I build that? Really? Can I build that? Yes, if you want to, but if your heart doesn't want to do it, you're not going to.

[00:22:58] Sue Bryce | So until you can stand in front of me authentically and tell me what the content is and how you're connected to it, and that you want it, and that you're going after it step by step, then you won't. So if you really want it, yes, why are you asking me for permission? I already did it. That's enough permission. If she did it, I can do it too.

[00:23:18] Sue Bryce | Let's go. The conversation always comes back to, am I on the right path? Am I on the right path, Sue? Just tell me I'm on the right path? Am I on the right path?

[00:23:30] Sue Bryce | Am I on the right path? Am I on the right path? What makes you believe I can feel that? All I can feel is the authenticity of what you're telling me. If you're not on the right path, I won't feel it.

[00:23:44] Sue Bryce | You're the only one that can feel if you're on the right path or not, and then don't stand up and say, am am I on the right path? Say, this is the path I'm creating for myself right now, and I am holding to it. I am focused on it. I am building the steps to it. I know what I want, and I'm walking towards it.

[00:24:05] Sue Bryce | Every single day. Now, listen. When you feel like you can't see the path ahead and you've gone blank, now's the time. The identity is done. You're not holding the old identity anymore.

[00:24:20] Sue Bryce | You're now ready to become this new one, and it's done, and the doing take a step. In order to get rid of a feeling of uncertainty, I just want you to get certainty around what you really want and what feels good for you every single day. That is the answer to manifestation. What is it that I really want, focus, and that I feel good around it? This is what I'm building.

[00:24:42] Sue Bryce | This is what I'm doing. And if you wake up in a day where you simply cannot find your power, you cannot that means you need self care. It means you need to eat, shower, rest, solitude, replenish creatively. Can't put your pressure on yourself to perform every single day. Uncertainty is fear certainty is I know what I want, and I feel good doing it.

[00:25:10] Sue Bryce | If you feel the fear of the unknown, that is no such thing, that is a lie. And if you say, I'm afraid and I go, cool. What are you most afraid of? I'm afraid of the unknown, Well, if it's unknown, how could you be afraid of it? You're not afraid of the unknown.

[00:25:29] Sue Bryce | You're afraid of rejection. It's that simple. You're asking, am I worthy? So if you have a fear of rejection, answer the question, am I worthy?

[00:25:40] Sue Bryce | Am I worthy to serve?

[00:25:40] Sue Bryce | Am I worthy to create? Am I worthy to give? Am I worthy to balance am I worthy to be more? If you can't answer that, you won't take another step forward. And whenever you go to do anything, there's a big dash of ego, and ego is just validation.

[00:26:00] Sue Bryce | Am I on the right path validate me that I'm good and that I'm a good girl, and that I'm a good boy, and I'm making the right decisions for me, validate me that I'm good enough to do this, and I'm on the right path. Nope. Validate yourself. And you validate yourself not by saying am I good enough, you validate yourself by saying, this is what feels good to me, and this is what I'm working towards and focused on every single day, every single day. So every time I've taken the biggest step in my evolution around identity, I go completely blank, and I don't know who I am.

[00:26:37] Sue Bryce | And that's why

[00:26:37] Sue Bryce | a focus group will tell

[00:26:37] Sue Bryce | me who I am. K. So if you think I get feedback from my team, they've been with me for 12 years, 12 years. Callen has heard me drop. Probably 2000 keynotes.

[00:27:01] Sue Bryce | Like, I'm not saying anything terribly new for Keller.

[00:27:04] Sue Bryce | He's not gonna give me feedback, but when he looks at me,

[00:27:05] Sue Bryce | genuinely looks at me and goes, great broadcast today. I feel it to my core. But the feedback from my husband, that's not the same. He's my business partner, but he's my husband. And the feedback I get online, they love you, or they hate you.

[00:27:28] Sue Bryce | They don't know you. No one online the criticism is people who wanna be you. The people who love you wanna be you. That's not real. Because you can get all this love and inflate your ego, and then the next thing is, hate.

[00:27:48] Sue Bryce | You suck. You're not even good. You're old. No one wants to see your face. Like, That's the polarity of online, so you can't buy into any of it.

[00:28:00] Sue Bryce | Craig told me that the day I walked on to my very 1st creative life, March 3 2012, he said, I need you to know something. Soo they love you as much as they hate you. They don't know you. Okay? I don't know how I thought I was gonna process that.

[00:28:23] Sue Bryce | I don't want to be loved or hated. I didn't want any of that. Why couldn't they just take the information and be happy with it? Why did I have to be celebrated as a cult or criticized entrolled because whatever people are seeing in me is in them,

[00:28:43] Sue Bryce | so I'm just attracting that. So you can't

[00:28:43] Sue Bryce | buy into any of that. What do you want What do you really want? Is the most powerful, and the most scary, and the most demanding question that I've ever had to ask myself, and I have to say it out loud ingrid. Women are not raised this way. Men are raised to look after themselves.

[00:29:11] Sue Bryce | We are raised to look after others. We don't ask ourselves. What do you really want? And it is the most transformative question you can ask yourself because you can't lie. It's like, absolutely incredible.

[00:29:19] Sue Bryce | So for my focus

[00:29:22] Sue Bryce | group,

[00:29:34] Sue Bryce | the Super Ice focus group, because I want to do this too, because I'm doing this workshop with you, because I do all of my workshops. And when I did the self value workshop, I reinvigorated all the love in my life. My husband, my friendships, my self care, when I did the content curated workshop, I wrote personal brand and speak, which are my next two workshops. And when I did personal brand, I realized I am at a crossroad.

[00:30:07] Sue Bryce | I am at

[00:30:07] Sue Bryce | a crossroad in my career and sew you. So listen to this. For my focus group, This is what I would say. I just thought I'll give you an idea of, I mean, I'd say a lot more than this, obviously. But I wanted to give you an idea of what I would ask for in this group.

[00:30:29] Sue Bryce | I find myself at a Crossroads in my career. But rather than seeing it as a point of limitation or even stagnation, like instead of feeling stuck, cause I've done this evolution so many times, I recognize this crossroad, this time, my 4th evolution, 5th evolution, sorry, this is my 5th evolution in business in 35 years. I recognize it as unfolding this new chapter in my next identity. When you create the new identity, you're not becoming something outside of you. You're unfolding the truest version from inside out.

[00:31:13] Sue Bryce | And that's where I stand right now. I'm no different than you. I am absolutely no different than you. Success for me is rooted in this deep an alignment. I have to feel it.

[00:31:30] Sue Bryce | I wanna feel my path, I wanna feel my community, I want to feel my content, and I need to feel like I'm creating from a place of love and from a place of just creative obsession. I wanna feel that I'm on the right path, and I wanna feel that everything I'm doing is magic. And I know that when I really look at what I want, and what I want to create, that's what I want. So this inner alignment, is not about external achievements. I don't want to sit in front of you and say, I want more money and I want external, and I want to be on Mel Robbins podcast, and I want to be on those are achievements, but they're physical.

[00:32:18] Sue Bryce | They're not for me, and they're not for my alignment, and what I wanna create. And they're also, You have to understand. When you start to conceptualize this new identity, you're like, I wanna speak around the world, do you? Do you have a family that you can travel around the world without your family? Do you have a supportive partner that will look after your children while you're traveling the world?

[00:32:46] Sue Bryce | Is that logistically even a possibility for you? Because sometimes we think of goals But when we actually think about doing them, living them, and actually creating that, like, energy, it's not really what you want. So it's so great to explore this space. I want clarity. I've gathered this incredible group of people because I value your insights, I value your wisdom, I value your perspectives, and I would like your help to illuminate my path ahead.

[00:33:22] Sue Bryce | Right?

[00:33:22] Sue Bryce | Because this is what I want to do, and I want a focus group dedicated to

[00:33:26] Sue Bryce | me. Does that make you feel uncomfortable, incredibly excited, or absolutely terrified? Alright? Tell me. Tell me now.

[00:33:47] Sue Bryce | So for my focus group, I prepared a short survey. The reason I did it in survey is because I'd love your feedback and your words. Right? Smart, because that survey can be online they can have their iPads there, you can have laptops there, you can tell them to bring a laptop so they can do an online survey. Or if you want to print the survey out, you can give it to them to mark, but it's very important you give them time to write in their words so that you get their words for chat so that you can curate more content around their words.

[00:34:22] Sue Bryce | So I have some product ideas to show you. The products that I already sell, I wanna show you how I sell them, and and what comes with all my packages so that you can give me feedback, but I would absolutely love to show you the new products I'm developing so that you can give me feedback and suggestions around how I can network and market that. And I would like to discuss further networking opportunities and show you some of my marketing content so that you can give me feedback as to what resonates, what feels the most authentic for my brand in me, and then anything else that I would like to know personally. Are there any questions?

[00:35:05] Chatroom Host | I had a few questions about how do you structure this focus group? These are clients and business owners?

[00:35:11] Sue Bryce | Okay. So logistically, it comes down to this is how you're gonna do it. If it's for you and you're just inviting a team of people, you can have ten people there, but they have to be, they're a best friend, a client, someone in your marketing network, or somebody that's going to bring something to the table. Now, if you're gonna do that, you have to reward them, right? Mhmm.

[00:35:38] Sue Bryce | Because why would I come to your work give you my expertise for cheese and crackers. Okay? So this is where you have to work out how to structure this for you. But one of the most interesting things is if I chose 5 businesses, then it would stand that five people rotate in 5 weeks, in five people, or you could do 2 at night, and, you know, or whatever, six people in 3 weeks, six people in 6 weeks, it doesn't matter as long as you have commitment from all of those people. Then you can do it that way.

[00:36:20] Sue Bryce | You know, it's two different things when I say a focus group of people you know, and then a focus group of 5 other businesses that will take turns. Those are 2 completely different events. Which one are you most drawn to, I'm so sorry. I think I'm getting allergies. I don't know why.

[00:36:39] Sue Bryce | I've never had allergies in my life. But I moved to Arizona, and this guy said, do you have allergies? And I was like, no. And he goes, you do now. And I was like, wow, it was my first day in Arizona.

[00:36:53] Sue Bryce | I stopped at a gas station. I sneezed, and a guy goes, Do you have allergies? And I was like, no, I don't get allergies. I definitely got allergies. Sorry.

[00:37:01] Sue Bryce | Okay. So rewarding them or return the service, return the service. I feel like if you're gonna return the service, So Melissa is a natural network car. She loves networking, and you would create a networking group like this in a heartbeat. So one of the things I would just warn is if you are the pole position organizing, you have to make it very clear what people get during that time, and that everyone has to contribute equally.

[00:37:31] Sue Bryce | So that's why four people might be better, because then it's only 5 weeks, or, you know, like, make sure that you're very clear about what you're bringing to this table. And obviously, if I'm in a networking focus group with Joe, and I'm in a networking focus group with Sam, and I'm in a networking focus group with 2 other people, but these 2 are can consistently, like giving, like, content to these people that I'm like, oh my god. I would grab those two people and keep changing out my 4th and 5th until I get this like, mastermind of just brand builders that are just gonna give you content ideas. Now, maybe it's content. Maybe it's

[00:38:15] Sue Bryce | content for your products and content for your marketing. So you want four people that are

[00:38:15] Sue Bryce | content oriented, that are content marketing. Now, when I'm working, Melissa, if you're pole position, if I'm working on Kate's brand, I'm not talking about myself, unless it's relevant to Kate. I'm not there to associate what Kate's getting for me. Oh, I'm the same. I'm the same.

[00:38:41] Sue Bryce | No, no, no, you write that down, and you bring it to your focus group. Because one of the hardest things to do is to create a group of people around you and then stand at the center of them and say, give me everything I need. Cause we feel bad, and we're all like, oh, oh, but you can't have people giving more or less than others. Oh my gosh. Thank you.

[00:39:05] Sue Bryce | So there you go. It's, definitely something you have to manage.

[00:39:12] Sue Bryce | Can you talk a

[00:39:13] Chatroom Host | little bit about the difference between these focus groups and the questionnaires that you send out to current clients.

[00:39:19] Sue Bryce | So the difference between a survey would be for feedback for people that you've actually served, and that's hard to hear, but it's very vital. But to me, the actual face to face is just an in person survey, but I've written all the questions that I want to know, and so I'm gonna give you all my questions to see if any spark you for your brand. So think about your brand first. So what questions to ask? Where do you need clarity?

[00:39:49] Sue Bryce | Where do you need clarity? We've already identified we're on a content umbrella with you. So we know we've defined it. We're now getting definition of the

[00:40:05] Sue Bryce | content, in vertical. So you're already taking

[00:40:05] Sue Bryce | that step that tells me you need more content focus group. You need a focus group that can make products. You need a focus group that can throw so many content ideas with what you're presenting that you can just easily start to go, yep. I'm gonna pull from that. Yep.

[00:40:26] Sue Bryce | I can pull from that. I love that feedback. Wow. They said that about me. So maybe in your client survey that you send out, you can ask, how did we do, you know, and in your own words, where can I improve?

[00:40:43] Sue Bryce | What would you like to see and you're getting all that feedback? And then your in person focus group is more asking questions around what you most need clarity around. So If you give people words in a survey, like a multi choice, they'll choose a word, but that might not be your word. Like, let's say I give you 4 adjectives to describe, a situation in your business, but you don't really think awesome or, you know, struggle is either, like, you're just, you're gonna just choose a word that is, and then what you're gonna get is a percentage of the multi choice. Like 18% said they're struggling, and 39% said they're okay.

[00:41:26] Sue Bryce | And that gives me nothing that just gives me a broad idea of what my audience is kind of struggling with. So if you give people words, they choose the words, but if you give if they give you their words, that's when you can create marketing copy from their words. Right? So there's lots of other ways to use surveys. Like, let's say, let's say you've created a little survey, but it's more of a fun one, and you put it out there on your social media.

[00:41:58] Sue Bryce | Answer these 10 marketing questions, and tell me why you're not making money in your small business. Can you imagine that? Now, that's clickbaity. Straight away, it's said something that makes me wanna go, What would the 10 marketing questions be? So straight away, I'm gonna click on to that reel, and I'm gonna look at those 10 marketing, and I'm gonna either answer a survey.

[00:42:21] Sue Bryce | It's harder to get people to leave social media to go and do a survey base. So if you can do this on your reels, if you can do it on polls, if you can do it on stories, you're getting constant engagement. Even if it's one to ten people, you're getting constant clicks, you're getting constant engagement. Now when you post, they look at how many likes, how many views, how many shares, and how many bookmarks. So every time you post, like it, share it, bookmark it, and send it to somebody else because it's you doing your own post, those things that get activated, you want as many people to save it as possible.

[00:42:58] Sue Bryce | Now if you put out a little survey like this, answer these 10 marketing questions, and tell me why you're not making money in your business. If you had a marketing course, that's the perfect thing for you to do because it instantly, even if they don't take the final step, which is a call to action, that right there is giving people information, and it's built your reels. What about this one? Answer these ten questions about self esteem or self worth, and tell me if you need to do a self love workshop. That question alone would be intriguing to so many people.

[00:43:35] Sue Bryce | Because that means the next ten questions I'm gonna ask are about your self worth and about your self esteem. And what happens if you start going through my questions and they start triggering and you, oh my gosh. I don't love myself. I don't feel connected at all, and then the final slide is this is my self love workshop. They can choose to keep clicking, but this is how we use surveys.

[00:44:00] Sue Bryce | This is how we use questions. This is how we use feedback. What if you created a brand new course, like personal brand? You put it out there, you started to sell it. The first thing I wanna do is survey my students, and I wanna survey them anonymously in the beginning.

[00:44:16] Sue Bryce | Or I can just choose to be anonymous whenever I want so that they can give me more real answers. But really, once I survey you, I get real stats. Okay. I don't get the fake version when I'm teaching the class of, like, how many of you guys are networking? Yeah.

[00:44:35] Sue Bryce | 80% of the room puts their hand up. But when I asked you in the survey, are you going to in person networking? It was only 18%. So you're either lying to me in person, or you're just like, yeah, what about? So that helps, like, narrow down to the truth, and it's about, like, getting that selling on the periphery.

[00:44:57] Sue Bryce | Because you're not selling anything. You're asking people questions about self value.

[00:45:00] Sue Bryce | You're asking people questions about marketing. Are you doing this in

[00:45:01] Sue Bryce | your marketing? And if your course is those 10 things. Ask the 10 questions of the 10 things you teach. And on your last slide, say, because I teach every one of those points, so how many of them do you need to learn to take the next step in your business? That that is connected marketing, that's surveying, that's asking

[00:45:28] Sue Bryce | the right questions, that's positioning yourself, and it's also educating the people feeling in the out that you know

[00:45:28] Sue Bryce | the answer to all those incredible questions, but they're going, ouch, ouch. Oh, I don't do that. Oh, yeah. I do that. Oh, no.

[00:45:44] Sue Bryce | I don't do that. Oh, I do that. Oh, I'm never doing that. And that's how you can get all of that information from people. So if I could solve This is your homework.

[00:45:55] Sue Bryce | If I could solve one big problem in

[00:45:55] Sue Bryce | your business right now, what would it be? And if I could solve one big problem with you selling,

[00:46:10] Sue Bryce | right now, what would that be? And if you and

[00:46:12] Sue Bryce | if I could solve one big problem for your marketing right now, what's your big problem with marketing?

[00:46:26] Sue Bryce | And if I could solve one big problem for you personally in your personal life right now, what would it be? Cause those four problems need to be solved, and those four problems are what is stopping you from getting to the next step. But all you have to do is identify what the problem is in each one of those. And if the problem you identify cannot be fixed by you, you cannot see the solution, and that means you're stuck, and that's not true.

[00:47:00] Sue Bryce | So if in that moment, you cannot solve the problem, or you cannot see a way to solve the

[00:47:04] Sue Bryce | problem, you're lying in that area, and it's either about your business overall, you're selling, your marketing, or something you're going through personally. So as soon as you can identify what it is that I could solve on a one on one session with me, what would that be, and tell me the problem, because once you know the problem, you're not problem focused anymore, your solution focused. And as soon as you know the solution to those 4 things, you are running at what you want. Right? Who's excited about a focus group?

[00:47:46] Sue Bryce | Ask me questions.

[00:47:49] Chatroom Host | I have a little testimonial for you.

[00:47:51] Sue Bryce | Oh, I love testimonial.

[00:47:53] Chatroom Host | And it's actually mine. 2 years ago, you asked me what do I want, and I had no idea. So I made the list of what I don't want. And then once I had that, I asked all of my loved ones what they thought my superpower was, and I watched to see which resonated with me. I did journals after journals after journals constantly looking back on the moments or what I was doing and the moments that lit me up the most And before you know it, I realized what it is that I wanted and also what my superpower was.

[00:48:25] Chatroom Host | Once the you create that that win, that group, that focus group at that point, then you know what you bring to the table. And you also know what you've also got.

[00:48:33] Sue Bryce | Get this superpower quickly or on their own, because you do it so effort that effortlessly that

[00:48:40] Sue Bryce | you don't realize it's a superpower. I always say to people, this is so crazy. It doesn't

[00:48:41] Sue Bryce | matter how stuck you feel It's right in front of you. It's right

[00:48:52] Sue Bryce | in front of you. You're not even saying it. Because when I unfold people in real time,

[00:49:04] Sue Bryce | I make something so obvious that they've just said that they go and I know you didn't see it. And I'm like, how did you not see

[00:49:09] Sue Bryce | that?

[00:49:18] Sue Bryce | Came out of your mouth. It's literally your aura.

[00:49:19] Sue Bryce | So because I'm a finely tuned bullshit detector, and I

[00:49:31] Sue Bryce | I read authenticity and truth. I'm blown away that people can't tell the truth of what they want. It's not that you don't know. That you can't say that you're worthless or, or you can't say I want that for myself. And I was like, No.

[00:49:58] Sue Bryce | A long time ago, I was like, I want that up there for myself, and if I can walk the steps to get there, I will be worthy of that path. If I can walk the steps to get there, I am worthy of this path. So I don't need to be worthy to walk the path. I need to know that every step I took, I took it knowing I was worthy to become what I want to be. I did what I said I was gonna do, finally.

[00:50:35] Sue Bryce | And I started to show up for myself every day, And I started to say, I am worthy of creating the life that I want for myself, and and it stops becoming about comparison, and it truly becomes about this belief that I'm not afraid to say this is what I want next. I'm just not afraid. So, check for any questions, but we just had a great chat before everyone walked in about chat EBT, and I want to show you some things on chat that are just intriguing, sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're mind blowing. So, one of the things that I did in my chat was I opened chair activity, and I wrote this. Can you create a survey for my personal brand

[00:51:39] Sue Bryce | workshop students from me personally, surprise? What I want to know about

[00:51:39] Sue Bryce | you and your business? And then I wrote, 25 questions, just questions of what I want to know. I didn't give multi choice. I did not give, like, different ways of answering the survey, and it instantly curated a perfect survey around every single one of those questions. So so easy to create a survey just by doing that, and then adjusting it and making it yours.

[00:52:15] Sue Bryce | And then, of course, you're going to take the survey and create the survey for your clients. So that was one way that I created a survey that worked really, really well, and it added to really cool things, and it gave me, like, multi choice, and it gave me some really good places for feedback. Excuse me, with the runny nose. Alright. Now I did something really different.

[00:52:41] Sue Bryce | Have you ever done a prediction on chat GBT? Okay. So it's really funny. This is all just for your own personal fun. Now every time I write a workshop, I write it out before I put it into slides I transfer all the content into chat.

[00:52:57] Sue Bryce | So chat has 65,000 words of mine, and I've been doing that over the last 6 months. So it's getting better and better at speaking in my voice, and I asked it to speak in my voice. So somebody told me to do this the other day. So I put all four workshops into chat, so it knows my content, and it's starting to speak with my words, my voice. And this is what I wrote of all the content from personal brand, content curator, self value, and speak workshop, which subject will be a hit workshop.

[00:53:34] Sue Bryce | Right. It's what I was which subject would be a hit book, and how can I build my empire around this content? Please give me a prediction. To determine what subject from your workshop's personal brand content curator, self other and speak, could be a hit as a workshop, and which might be a hit as a book. Let's break it down based on your current ethos audience demand and the trends and personal branding, entrepreneurship, and speaking, speak workshop is a hit workshop.

[00:54:07] Sue Bryce | The speak workshop has the strongest potential to become a highly sought after in demand event. Here's why, and it gave me basically written me a full description of my workshop, why it stands out above all my content. And then it said it identified in my content that mirror mirror is a concept developed by me and that that would be the basis of a, best selling book. And it it's gives you a prediction. It gives you scriptions.

[00:54:42] Sue Bryce | It gives you forecasts about the future. It's mind blowing. Okay. So that's what I wrote first. And, then I did another one with this morning, so it gave me a big printout about my hip book.

[00:54:56] Sue Bryce | About my workshop, about all this cool stuff I can build, create products I can create around it. Okay. This time, I did the survey. Alright. Now okay.

[00:55:09] Sue Bryce | With all the information, Joe told me this this morning, this will blow your mind. With all the information

[00:55:19] Sue Bryce | you have about me and based on what you can find

[00:55:19] Sue Bryce | online about me, surprise. What is your prediction for my future career? Oh my gosh. I just got like this 4 page printout. And listen to this.

[00:55:34] Sue Bryce | It's so funny, but it's also awesome because it like, even if you look at it, purely as a creative writing exercise. Listen to some of the language in here that I could use. And number 1, expansion of your empire as a thought leader, you are already a highly successful entrepreneur, educator, and speaker the next phase of your career will solidify you as one of the most influential thought leaders in personal branding creative entrepreneurship and empowerment. Given your deep understanding of self worth, alignment, transformation, your message will resonate on a global scale beyond just your current audience and of photographers and creatives. Like, the the stuff that it's saying, and there's, like, five pages, and it just keeps going on.

[00:56:18] Sue Bryce | It's like, this is a multi channel, multi channel content. It expansion predictions for my development, original book. I've got growth and empowered community and legacy, legacy as a coach, my prediction for, it just keeps going and it's like, my prediction for your career in the next 5 years. And because I put so much of my content in there, so start uploading your content so it can really get to know you and get to know your voice because This is a tool that we've been using for a long time. You know, we've been using, AI for a long time.

[00:56:57] Sue Bryce | When you go to any business in the last 20 years and you're on a chatbot, that's AI, and AI can be used in your business in a million different ways, but just that prediction really blew my mind. And as I was going through it, it was saying things and giving me, you're gonna love it's ideas for products, right? Because knowing for well, I already know what products I wanna create. It was like, you could create an international online workshop. You could create an accreditation program, you got, and it gave me all that.

[00:57:30] Sue Bryce | And I was like, yeah, yeah, I got all that, but it's like, how cool is that, and that absolutely blew my mind? Okay. So go chat. So, yeah, get your predictions. Oh, my questions my questions that I wanted to know,

[00:57:46] Sue Bryce | my questions would be relevant to the clarity that I need, so they won't be relevant to you.

[00:57:46] Sue Bryce | But if I could ask you a question about your business that would be, like, relevant. These are the questions that I would want to know. What's your 3 by 3? Cause I'd want you to write that out, and I'd want to know it are you a personal brand or a company brand? Do you feel clarity, connection, and value presenting your brand?

[00:58:17] Sue Bryce | What path brought you to creating this brand? Did the $1,000,000 dream change your path? I am most interested, and

[00:58:23] Sue Bryce | if anybody got anything out of

[00:58:23] Sue Bryce | that, that changed my life. And I guess some people will be like, meh, whatever, you get a 1,000,000 fake $1,000,000 check and you imagine what you're going to do with it, but when you imagine what you're going to do with it and it's different to what you're doing, that's a game changer. And I really want to know how people went with that, so that's where I'm most interested in. Do you offer a, a physical product, a digital product, a physical service, or a digital service, and we're interested in what you actually sell, what product service brings you the most income? Are you currently at 5, 6, 7, or 8 figures in your brand?

[00:59:09] Sue Bryce | What's different or unique about you? How do you position yourself in your field or industry? Are you in love with your products? Have you mastered pricing? What money level are you at?

[00:59:23] Sue Bryce | Have you found marketing clarity? Have you found your voice? What is your next business goal? What is your next personal goal? Where do you get stuck?

[00:59:36] Sue Bryce | How do you self sabotage yourself? What is the one thing you would like to overcome? How much of your body image are you projecting into your brand? Are you holding yourself back because of how you look? What is the best system you've created for your business

[00:59:53] Sue Bryce | so far? What is the most needed new system for your business right now? Why do you feel

[00:59:53] Sue Bryce | when do you feel the most amount of authenticity doing what you do. Do you feel like you're in alignment with this brand? Do you feel like you're on the right path? And does this feel good to you? That's what I want to know.

[01:00:17] Sue Bryce | As a coach, that's what I want to know. I need to know if your emotional physical connection to this brand and businesses in alignment And until it's in alignment with what you really want and that path, that next step that you're taking, that's all I'm doing is trying to get that clarity in there so that we can move the needle from that point on. Who in this room would do a focus group if they were invited to 1, where you all get to do it? No, Sam?

[01:00:49] Sue Bryce | Only because I'm still starting out. So I would love to be a part of making for some money, but I

[01:00:51] Sue Bryce | would have Yeah. Because really until you're ready to be in a brand, and we just did that without a mic. So Sam actually said she's developing her new brand, so she's not there yet that she would feel ready enough to do a focus group around that brand. Although if you felt like you could bring enough to the table as a contributor to other people, maybe what yours could be would be the vision for your brand because until you've created the brand, you're in the vision stage, and you're not creating the identity yet, but you're also taking steps towards the making of that vision, choosing a name, choosing colors, choosing a website, and you'll be quite amazed at the connection in there to those very early steps And just because you haven't created the brand, the product, or the income yet, does not mean that it's fully formed in your head as a vision and that it could come out as if this is my business plan, You know, one of the things about growing anything is the first stage that I got to was when you tell people your next step and they poo poo it.

[01:02:01] Sue Bryce | And when you're new and you wanna do something that feels really big in our side of you and somebody poo poo's that next step, it's soul crushing. But what you got was their limits, and I would like to go into a network where there are no limits. Where there's no limits to what they could tell me about what I could do for my next step. And I don't think of anything better than that than creating these hot seats. So like, I am so excited to see what you all do with that.

[01:02:35] Sue Bryce | Are there any questions?

[01:02:37] Chatroom Host | Just where do they get all of those questions that you just beautifully riddled off?

[01:02:41] Sue Bryce | Well, when you download the homework, but Jen's not Jen is, sick this week. She's out. So what I'm gonna do is I'll get you this keynote, and it's in the keynote. I'll get you the ugly keynote, and I will replace it. I'm sorry for the ugly keynote, but I can't design keynotes like Jen can.

[01:02:59] Sue Bryce | And, yeah, all those questions are there, but also it's really important that you

[01:03:03] Sue Bryce | write your own. I will also give you the chat questions that I put in,

[01:03:03] Sue Bryce | and then the questions chat generated for the survey because they look extraordinarily different. One is a list of questions. The other one is a whole bullet point, moldy choice, giving me options. And I was like, you know, you can get so much help with marketing copy, with chat, with feedback, this way that's not chat writing things for you, but really just organizing content for you. Everything that you can possibly give chat, feed it in.

[01:03:37] Sue Bryce | This is a whole spiel about me. If you wanna know how to get a spiel, get your phone, or your iPad, and do a voice memo, no, don't do a voice memo. Go to text, text yourself. Right? Write a text to yourself, hit the microphone, and then just sit there going, my name is Sue Bryce, I am a photographer, I am an educator, and I am a speaker, and speak it all out so the words are all just getting typed out, and then copy and paste and just go and put it into chat.

[01:04:10] Sue Bryce | And chat's like, whoop? And my website is. My name is. I've been doing this for this years. I was most challenged by my superpower is.

[01:04:19] Sue Bryce | My businesses. My focus is. This is how much money I make. Give it to chat, and then it will generate, you know, it just instantly generates text about you, and then you can go back anytime and say, with what you know about me, could you please help me but the more information you give it, like, these are the questions I would ask in a survey. Could you please help me write the survey to and also, when it wrote the survey, this is what it did, and of course I can change anything.

[01:04:51] Sue Bryce | But this blew me away, because when I said Can you create a survey for my personal brand workshop students from me personally, Subrise? What I want to know about you and your business? Then I put in the questions. Then it said, here's a personalized survey for your personal brand workshop students designed to gather deep insights into your business and help them reflect on their own brand clarity. So it identified that in me giving you all these questions, It's gonna help you reflect.

[01:05:22] Sue Bryce | So while you're doing my survey, you're getting what? Confirmation that I know shit. Confirmation. She knows what I need. Oh my gosh.

[01:05:30] Sue Bryce | She's talking to me. That's exactly what I want. That's exactly what I need. And and they're getting that confirmation just in my survey. So thank you for participating in my personal brand workshop.

[01:05:41] Sue Bryce | I'm excited to learn more about you and your business. The survey is designed to help me understand where you are at in your journey. The unique qualities of your brand and how I can best support you, take your time answering these questions. I want to get to know the real you and your brand. That was the intro that chat wrote.

[01:06:01] Sue Bryce | And that better than an intro I could have written. So I was like, nice. Straight away. What is your 3 by 3? Who are you?

[01:06:10] Sue Bryce | What are you doing? Who do you do it for? It was the first one, 2, 3. I never wrote that. So the fact that it's giving me all of this content that I can help, maybe you put it into chat and say, I want feedback around my marketing or my social media.

[01:06:24] Sue Bryce | So you make it about social media content, then you send it out. Maybe it's about my experience. What is the subrace experience? I won't know what the subrace experience is until you tell me what it's like having the experience. I can create the experience.

[01:06:40] Sue Bryce | I can tell you what the experience is, but you are the only one that can tell me how the experience feels, and you're the only one that can say this is what I experienced. And that is the truth. If I take whatever words in that moment that you give me and I create marketing copy from that, that is the most authentic feedback you can receive from a human being. Yeah. That's so cool.

[01:07:06] Sue Bryce | Don't be afraid of asking for feedback. You've gotta be good in order you gotta suck in order to be good. You gotta be both, to someone you're always gonna suck. No matter what you do, it just you will always trigger somebody in that way. It does not matter.

[01:07:21] Sue Bryce | Okay. Ask some questions. Alright. Ask me questions so I can wrap them up, and I won't keep you for such a long session today. Sounds like some are really excited and some are really terrified, but

[01:07:45] Chatroom Host | so everybody's got a little bit more clarity on the kind of feedback

[01:07:48] Sue Bryce | they need. Can

[01:07:48] Sue Bryce | you tell me who wouldn't do it right now? Like, I get that Sam's new, but even you. So Sam, when it comes to, like, creating this new brand, What area of brand do you feel like you're strong at? Would you say, I think networking, I think marketing, or I think systems, or I think, like, what area instantly goes, oh, these are my areas? Well, I like doing systems for other people, like, kinda helping them get organized and stuff like that.

[01:08:15] Sue Bryce | And then also, like, day of help. Basically, it's a So you could be part of a focus group by telling people what you bring to the table if it's what they need. Right. You know, in exchange for the newbie, but again, I would probably be more at an advanced level. My group, because my business is at an advanced level, so I would more likely choose people who are at a little bit more of an advanced level, but from a start up level, that would make you perfect for that.

[01:08:46] Sue Bryce | Okay.

[01:08:46] Sue Bryce | Yeah. So really, I think what's important is that we identify what we each bring to the table. And what we bring to the table that can actually help the person that's sitting in the

[01:08:56] Sue Bryce | hot seat. Otherwise, it's not gonna feel good, or it's not

[01:08:56] Sue Bryce | gonna really benefit you. And, yeah, I hope lots of you start this, and I would love to do one. Alright. No more questions. Anybody in here got a question?

[01:09:22] Sue Bryce | Can I be a personal brand and a company brand? I'm always told I am biting my brand, so that's good. Do I develop my personal brand? So if you're a company brand, it's a name that's not yours, and it usually means you're going to have business partners. Unless my name, Subrise was licensed as a company.

[01:09:40] Sue Bryce | So I'm Subrise Education. They licensed my name, and I had business partners, but my personal name was licensed as a company brand. Normally, if you're a company brand, you're not your name, and therefore, you're building it to sell, or you're building it to be 8 figures or more. And because company brands get to 8 figures, personal brands not company brands with licensed names get to 8 figures, but personal brands don't because it's too much for a sole print solo printer to create systems around you to get to 8 figures. But the idea is if you're a personal brand, you've gotta be the person in the brand.

[01:10:22] Sue Bryce | So how crazy that of all the 400 personal brands during this workshop, none of you had about pages that represented a personal brand, not even me. And yet, because we're personal brands, we have to be the main feature of that website because we chose to be called our name. Now if you're a company brand, the goal is to personalize it. So you can be the person in the brand. You can be the person and the brand.

[01:10:53] Sue Bryce | Steve Jobs, Apple, 2 brands, a company brand, a personal brand, but collectively, Jordan, Nike. The most popular growth of the biggest brands are when you take a company brand and a personal brand, and you merge them together, we don't follow people. So we don't follow companies. We follow people. So if you're a company brand, you have to be the person in the brand, if you wanna connect it.

[01:11:20] Sue Bryce | Personal brands are trying to grow and stand out. Company brands are trying to be more personalized. So that they're not just a company or a corporation. So you can absolutely call your business something else, but you must exist as a personal brand in your business. Otherwise, you're not building yourself in that business and usually that's because you're hiding.

[01:11:44] Sue Bryce | Alright. Do you have another place to learn more about masterminds and balancing time each member ask me now. We're right in it. Like, we're literally sitting in it. Like, up to the armpits, but you want me to find another resource for you to go and get more answers for afterwards, Ariel.

[01:12:08] Sue Bryce | Here I am. I'm about to shut it down. So start asking me questions. If you guys don't ask me questions, I just fill this space and then I go. So go, go.

[01:12:18] Sue Bryce | Come on. Let's go. We've got at least 15 minutes, and I'll still get you out of here in an hour and a half.

[01:12:24] Chatroom Host | Ingrid's asking, how do you find the right group? Do some casting because you mentioned starter and advanced groups.

[01:12:31] Sue Bryce | Okay. A startup group would be five people at Sam's level who are conceptualizing a brand and have not launched yet. Do you have a website? No. So no website, right?

[01:12:42] Sue Bryce | That's a startup collective of startup businesses. You're talking about a whole lot of people that now have concepts, and they're now bringing together what will my products be, what will my brand look like? Okay. And then there's a brand that's operational, taking money might not be profitable, but they've got to change something, evolve something, or go to the next level. And that there is where I'd see, 2 different teams.

[01:13:11] Sue Bryce | A more advanced level, I'm not looking for people that have $10,000,000 companies to be in a more advanced mastermind. I'm looking for people that have an expertise in a certain field. Like my friend Sally Sarkoed, she's 10 years of animoto marketing video.

[01:13:30] Sue Bryce | She knows more about video marketing stats and, like,

[01:13:30] Sue Bryce | the playbook that I've ever heard anybody say, and she's so up to date, I would instantly put her on my, in my panel, because she can bring a marketing video insight to me on a broadcasting level, on an advertising level, marketing level that is really extraordinary. I want players like her, now she doesn't own a company, and she does not has not built, $1,000,000 company, but what she does is specializes in this one incredible field. So I would 100% want her on my focus group. She also has a part time online business, and I know that if I pitched it to her, she would fly here, do that for 4 others, and do mine and we'd be able to do hers as well, because I'm watching this marketing expert, not being a marketing expert in her own brand. Because it's hard when it's your brand, right?

[01:14:32] Sue Bryce | And you do it for other people. And then you're like, So it's like we bring something, as long as there's something to the table, you would definitely have to gather the right people, and you'd also have to be prepared for disappointment. Like, let's say, Natalie comes to our group, we do her brand first, she gets so much out of it, and then she's a no show, or, you know, she's comes to the group, but she's quite shut down, talks about herself. In that moment, you're gonna have four people that are very disappointed. So it almost has to be in a way where it's like, you could do three people that you really trust, a triangle, and just say, the 3 of us are gonna do this in one day.

[01:15:17] Sue Bryce | We're gonna spend 2 hours on your brand, 2 hours on your brand and then 2 hours on mine. And we're gonna clear cut in between each 2 hours, go to break, go and eat lunch, walk away, finish off. Like, if we spent the morning with Sam, Sam's eating lunch going, guys. I'm like, my mind is blown. I'm terrified.

[01:15:37] Sue Bryce | I I look at my notes. I'm like, I can't believe this. But Sam's questions are answered at before lunch is finished. And then we go straight in, and now we're focused on you. And it's just all you for the next 2 hours.

[01:15:53] Sue Bryce | Now, that's a day together, 3 powerhouse people that can all bring something to the table. It won't take long to find your people. You know, you just have to understand how do human beings work. You're not giving as much as I give. I gave so much more than they gave, and then we're out of balance.

[01:16:12] Sue Bryce | Okay. Once people feel out of balance, it not fair. Me, me, me, me, me, and there's no crying in baseball. So this is no I don't wanna deal with this drama. I wanna make sure my crew is there to move the needle my needle, and then I wanna move your needle.

[01:16:28] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Also, Craig didn't write in the chat when do we start filming? I'm quite surprised by that. Okay. Have how have focus groups shaped your biggest breakthroughs?

[01:16:40] Sue Bryce | For me, I'll tell you something that happened, Sarah, I didn't even know how this happened. I built my little home studio in the garage when I first started out. And I was, how am I gonna do this? You know, back then, that story, couldn't market my I've couldn't ask for money. My boss used to sell my work for $7000, $4000.

[01:17:04] Sue Bryce | I couldn't get 400. Every time I went into a sales session, they would tell me I was cheap, fold their arms, shut me down, I was like, I don't know. It's the same work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I worked out.

[01:17:16] Sue Bryce | I didn't know anything about money. I'm overgiver. I'm I'm repelling people around money. I couldn't speak money out. I'm learning all this stuff.

[01:17:26] Sue Bryce | I did a group back then, and

[01:17:27] Sue Bryce | Robert Bacoli turned up. Robert Bacoli is one of the most awarded, successful portrait photographers in Australia. He's about, I'd know, twenty years older than me,

[01:17:42] Sue Bryce | So if I was doing this in 2000 and that was 2005, 9, 20 years ago? Okay. So 20 years ago, I was, what, 33 in the feedback, he said to me now I've just built my studio in the garage. What he didn't know? Oh my god.

[01:18:03] Sue Bryce | My old boss said, Sue's just built that garage studio. I'm gonna drive you down there. I don't this guy's studio Melbourne is $3,000,000. But can you imagine coming to my garage in my little old country house? Robert Bacoli used to make wedding albums that were about the wedding album alone was about a $1000.

[01:18:24] Sue Bryce | And then you'd put the photos in because he did weddings in Melbourne that were, like, $100,000 for the wedding photos, and he was the highest end. One day, we had one of his albums at our studio in New Zealand, and it had a gouge on it And I had to unscrew the album, take the pages out, order a new album from Melbourne, replace it. And as I was wrapping it for the new client, I looked at this big metal album Folio cover. It was like this big. And I knew it was like a $1000.

[01:18:58] Sue Bryce | And all they had to do was like put new pages in it. And it had a gouge on the back, but who cares? It was big metal. So my boss threw it in the trash, and I got in the dumpster. I didn't tell my boss.

[01:19:14] Sue Bryce | I snuck into the dumpster when I got into my car that night and took it. So over the year, I'd saved spare pages from building these beautiful big albums, and I had these all these spare pages. So I built this album smack bang in my studio. I had a $1000 Robert Fekola Folio album, a big one, retoured everything, and I was like, I have to hide it because he's coming to my studio, and I took it out of the dumpster. I never told him I had it.

[01:19:48] Sue Bryce | And, It's so funny. He walked in, and then we're doing the feedback, and I told him that I did this feedback group to work out, because people were telling me you can't start a business without wedding photography. And I was like, but I don't shoot weddings. I don't wanna do weddings. You can't start a portrait business without babies, your families.

[01:20:09] Sue Bryce | And I was like, but I don't wanna do that. I just wanna do this one genre, and everyone keeps saying no. So I got smart people in the room, and they asked them, and nobody said no. Robert Bacoli said something to me that day, but nearly made me throw up in my mouth. He looked at me, and he said, I see you at the forefront of international photography in the next 5 years.

[01:20:32] Sue Bryce | This was before I even thought about leaving the studio I was about to build. This was before I built the studio in town, before I left, like, way before then, and I was like, wait, you see me? At the forefront of international photography in the next 5 years. And I said, yeah, and I was like, Weird, wrote it down. And to this day, I still marvel at that.

[01:21:00] Sue Bryce | Because I built my studio in the city 3 years later, and I was there for 2 years before I went to Australia to build it. I wasn't even education was not on my mind, franchise was not on my mind. I hadn't even built my big studio yet. And when he said it to me, I laughed, but

[01:21:15] Sue Bryce | I knew it was truth. The cells in my body, when he's speaking the truth.

[01:21:29] Sue Bryce | And I was like, how could he be speaking? The truth?

[01:21:32] Sue Bryce | But it's so deceit. And it was a seed of, I know that's

[01:21:40] Sue Bryce | true. And if that's what I want, then I need to create the next steps to get there. Right? And you can have whatever you want in your timeline if you create the timeline to it. So the feedback is about giving you knowledge.

[01:21:59] Sue Bryce | Another feedback that changed my will was there was, dude at the end at IPP, and he was very high up with Fuji Australia, and he was presenting there. And I did a focus with him as well, group with him, And he ended up coming to my studio, the big studio in the city, and saw that for the first time. And he gave me feedback that day that changed my life. He sat down, and he said, I have been to Maybe 500 studios in New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, and I have never seen a business like this. Never.

[01:22:52] Sue Bryce | He said, I have two questions for you.

[01:22:54] Sue Bryce | Who are you? And where have you been? And I was like, my name is Sue Bryce.

[01:23:04] Sue Bryce | And I've been busy. When he told me that, I was like, what do you mean? I have something special? I couldn't see it. I study speakers.

[01:23:20] Sue Bryce | I study them. I watch them for authenticity. I watch them for cadence, for

[01:23:22] Sue Bryce | tone, for content. I watch their body language. I watch how confident they

[01:23:22] Sue Bryce | are, how comfortable they are, how powerful they are, I watch myself. I don't get it. I don't see it. I don't know why people resonate with my voice. I watch it.

[01:23:40] Sue Bryce | Sometimes I watch it and I go, oh, that was really good. But I don't see it. You cannot see it when it's you. And the way somebody else sees you is like, it's a game changer. It's like so all that feedback made me understand I'm better than I think I am.

[01:24:00] Sue Bryce | And I have more than I think I have. And I have a whole lot to

[01:24:05] Sue Bryce | give people. And if I keep doing this and making money

[01:24:05] Sue Bryce | doing it, then I can 100% show people how to do that. So it gave me, like, the steps that

[01:24:16] Sue Bryce | I needed to go forward. Mhmm. We have a few questions now. What are the time investments that you suggest for these focus groups?

[01:24:16] Sue Bryce | You know,

[01:24:19] Sue Bryce | I

[01:24:29] Sue Bryce | How much are you prepared to give back? Cause whatever time you take, you must be prepared to pay for an equal exchange or value. So whatever your equal exchange or value is what it should be.

[01:24:42] Chatroom Host | In your experience, do you recommend somebody using their own name as their brand?

[01:24:46] Sue Bryce | I think you are a personal brand or a company brand. A company brand is to grow and to sell.

[01:24:47] Sue Bryce | It makes it a lot easier. A personal brand is around you. And you can grow within the personal brand and evolve it as much as you want, but it really comes down to do you plan on having business partners? Cause if you do, it's a company brand. Do you plan on selling it?

[01:25:09] Sue Bryce | It's a company brand. And if you plan on building it

[01:25:12] Sue Bryce | around you, it's a personal brand. What if your business is you and your partner? Then you're

[01:25:12] Sue Bryce | a company brand. But if it's your name, then that person has license over your name, so be careful. Cause I

[01:25:27] Sue Bryce | charge for licensing my name. What if the people you want in your focus

[01:25:27] Sue Bryce | group aren't really interested in your specific business or brand? Don't let them come into your focus group. Tell them to create their own.

[01:25:42] Chatroom Host | Would you invite somebody who

[01:25:44] Sue Bryce | is in the exact same z business as you? Oh, this is a big one. Okay. I can objectively give you feedback as

[01:25:44] Chatroom Host | a photographer.

[01:25:54] Sue Bryce | Because I am an educator of photographers.

[01:25:57] Sue Bryce | Also, I can give you feedback as a photographer because there is

[01:25:57] Sue Bryce | no ego in my feedback. Like, if you're a better photographer than me, that's the first feedback you'll get. You're way better

[01:26:12] Sue Bryce | than I was. I'm not shy about that. Like, it's real life for me, but I'm a little bit unique like that. So,

[01:26:22] Sue Bryce | I've recently been, you know, I pick and choose who I brainstorm with, but I just realized I've been brainstorming with somebody that that has their best interests instead of mine, because they've started to, like, anything I say they've started to take those steps. And I was like, for themselves. Mhmm. And I was like, that's cool, but it's clearly in a way that it's, like, not for me. And I was like, oh, so you have to be careful who you give an equal exchange too, and they have to.

[01:26:51] Sue Bryce | So I would say pre interview, really sit down and talk, show them who the players are, what they bring to the table. I would start with three people and build up from there if you wanted to. Yeah. But, like, keep it tight.

[01:27:05] Chatroom Host | Do you have any recommendations on how to ask for a focus group and how to set expectations?

[01:27:10] Sue Bryce | Okay. So the first thing I would do is create a focus group. Like, I can afford a chef's dinner, and it's so valuable to me that I could do that and pay $300, $400 for a fancy chef to cook at a table for 10. That to me would be a way to get you there, but I want you to work when you're there. I want you to give while you're there, and

[01:27:36] Sue Bryce | I also want you to receive. So I'm more interested in a focus group where

[01:27:36] Sue Bryce | it's we take turns. You know, could you charge for it? Yes. You could. And then you're gonna get a whole lot of people that have to show up because they're paid for it.

[01:27:53] Sue Bryce | But keeping it small at 1st to 3 would be one day, one whole day together or or 3 days over 2 weeks, or one day a week for 3 weeks, we focus on 1 business a week. You know, I would start small and go

[01:28:07] Sue Bryce | from there. Yeah, it would be

[01:28:07] Sue Bryce | hard if the person that you're talking to wants some the same things that you want. Okay. For instance, we were at Lewis House Workshop, and

[01:28:22] Sue Bryce | there's, I think, four thousand people in the audience. And there's a lot of great speakers on stage. They're all on,

[01:28:23] Sue Bryce | you know, Instagram. They're all big fellows. Every one of them had a book, and every one of them had at

[01:28:37] Sue Bryce | least 2,000,000 followers on Instagram. I don't have a book. I have 200,000 followers on Instagram. When you compare me

[01:28:37] Sue Bryce | to Esther Parral or, you know, David Goggan so that I would not qualify for that stage. And I've been speaking for 15 years. Am I good enough to stand on that stage? Yes. And if I wanted to be on that stage, I would have to take at least 4 new steps towards focusing on getting on those big stages, grow my audience, start posting more coaching work, and I'm still at my crossroads.

[01:29:16] Sue Bryce | I'm still teaching all the content that I know to see what lights me up, to see what moves your needle, to see what connects to me. That's why doing the prediction is so incredible. Because you do this prediction, and it's telling you what, you know, it's just a prediction on chat, but giving me all of these words and ideas, and it's really powerful. So yeah.

[01:29:39] Sue Bryce | If you

[01:29:39] Chatroom Host | are a luxury brand, would you only do this with other luxury brands?

[01:29:45] Sue Bryce | Sally's not a luxury brand. Sally's now running the WPPI, but she's the first person I would put at that table for her knowledge base. Somebody who has an extraordinary knowledge base on networking or marketing, It's gonna give you maybe more feedback than somebody else. So choose your players wisely. And then also, there has to be really good questions that you're asking, the people that are coming What do you see as what what most feedback can you do for me?

[01:30:16] Sue Bryce | Like, what where do you feel that you can most help me as a panel? And what clarity are you most looking for as a hot seat? For this panel because you're actually gonna give the hot seat your questions. It's what you need clarity on. So you write the questions for yourself.

[01:30:35] Sue Bryce | Yeah. Very cool. This is gonna be such a fun, interesting thing to do. Alright, guys. Thank you very much.

[01:30:51] Sue Bryce | We'll see you next week, next Thursday. I do hope to have Jen back. Sorry for the ugly keynote. So I will get you the ugly keynote with the questions and with the chat survey too, because it's really mind blowing. And I want you to start using chat more to help you with your copy, and I want you to start building a focus group around you.

[01:31:12] Sue Bryce | You know, a lot of you have that one person that they can bounce off that usually in a similar industry, you know, or the same industry, they have that one person that can really understand them, start there, and say if we were to create a third person, who would that be? And, truly, I wanna see what comes out of this because it is the weirdest thing that you you don't know who you are until somebody tells you, and then you're like, Wow. You don't know how good you are? And you don't know what you know until you go to teach it. And every time I see you guys get stuck, I ask myself, I got stuck.

[01:31:59] Sue Bryce | How did I get unstuck? And then as soon as I write out that solution of how I did it, And then how I saw other people do it, and then how other people tried different things that didn't work and did work. And and then I give you a few options to go forward, I can solve your problem every single time. So it's like, it's incredible when people speak back to you, and they're telling you everything that you are, you're just going to sit there and think this whole time, I was walking around acting like I was not special. And turns out the whole time I am.

[01:32:41] Sue Bryce | Alright. Go make magic.
